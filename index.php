Nvidia is struggling in the AI revolution.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/01/30/02/19/img/20250130-0219-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250130-0219-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>Wednesday was a good day for Apple in the stock market where the growth was not impressive for the company, but solid enough to maintain its position as the richest company in the world. The freefall in the company’s stock price experienced since the beginning of 2025 stopped on 21 Jan 2025 to keep results flat, and the growth has started since 27 Jan 2025.</p><p>Nvidia may have claimed victory too early when Tuesday seemed to be the calm after the heavy storm of Monday with the news of DeepSeek, a new startup competitor from China in the artificial intelligence race. But a new storm was restarted on Wednesday with alarming and poor results for Nvidia in the price of its stock. At this pace, Nvidia does not seem to be in good shape to obtain again the title of richest company in the world. Currently, Nvidia is number 3 and even on its way to be a company worth less than $3 trillion. In recent months and weeks Nvidia seemed to be in a realistic position to become the first company in the world to reach the historic $4 trillion mark in market capitalization. The situation has changed and now Nvidia needs to find the way to become again the headquarters of the artificial intelligence revolution, in a market environment where competition is fierce and Nvidia is no longer fighting for a monopoly, but for surviving to belong to the ranking of the elite top 3 richest companies on the planet.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 2:19 AM GMT · Jan 30, 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
