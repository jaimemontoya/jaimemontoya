Broadcom had a bad Friday in a volatile AI market. Walton lost $1 billion on Friday. Zuckerberg a serious contender for the richest person title.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/02/15/02/13/img/20250215-0213-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250215-0213-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>Nvidia is again in a solid pattern of growth that started on 4 Feb 2025. 2025 is again taking a positive balance for Nvidia’s stock price, which had suffered a dramatic fall with the news that emerged at the end of January 2025, about DeepSeek developing a significant breakthrough in inference speed over previous models. Investors surely feared that the demand for Nvidia’s powerful chips would be reduced. The situation seems to be back to normal for Nvidia, and investors are again making Nvidia’s stock grow and prosper.</p><p>Broadcom’s stock price fell in the same way as Nvidia’s stock, when the DeepSeek news emerged last month. Nonetheless, Broadcom recovered quickly and since 28 Jan 2025, it had been on a trajectory of growth that stopped on 10 February 2025. Since then, the price has remained approximately flat. The volatility in the AI race will give great opportunities to Broadcom in 2025, but it will also include threats and risks for a company that is already volatile in the stock market.</p><p>Rob Walton lost almost $1 billion on Friday, when Walmart had negative results in the stock market, but nothing to be alarmed about for a company that has experienced a 15.60% stock price growth only in 2025.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg is a serious contender to become, one day, the richest person in the world. Currently, he is number 2. That is a position that he has already enjoyed in the past. His company, Facebook, is in a highly competitive and volatile market: technology. In addition, the AI revolution is also competitive and volatile. Friday was another great day for Meta in the stock market. In 2025, Meta’s stock price has increased 22.93%, moving from $599.24 on 2 Jan 2025, to $736.67 on 14 Feb 2025. No other company in the top ten richest companies in the world, has had such a consistent trajectory of uninterrupted growth in 2025. The future is extremely bright and promising for Meta and Zuckerberg. The company has been able to intelligently navigate the AI race and revolution up to this time.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 2:13 PM GMT · 15 Feb 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
