Broadcom experiencing solid growth. Nvidia struggling to remain as the AI leader. Page having all-time high price for Alphabeth’s stock. Arnault struggling again as he was in 2024.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/02/01/04/54/img/20250201-0454-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250201-0454-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>Broadcom had lost its position of 9th richest company in the world when on 28 Jan 2025, Berkshire Hathaway took that place. Now the situation has changed to the previous state and Broadcom is number 9 in the ranking.</p><p>Other than the terrible fall in the stock price of Broadcom that happened on 27 Jan 2025, the company has not experienced any other significant fall since it started its remarkable trajectory of growth around 29 Nov 2025. The nightmare of DeepSeek, the Chinese AI start-up, has not lasted more than one day for Broadcom and since Tue, 28 Jan to the end of the week on Fri, 31 Jan, Broadcom looks strong and back on track to impressive growth.</p><p>Nvidia is raising major concerns about its future in the AI race. The DeepSeek news was undoubtedly shocking news for Nvidia stock that hurt its price. Nonetheless, the fall cannot be reduced to a single day and event. DeepSeek should not be blamed for what is happening to Nvidia in recent weeks or months. This is a moment where a major question has been raised: Is it game over for Nvidia stock? It is difficult to know. The success of the business model for Nvidia in the AI revolution has been based on AI models requiring ever-increasing powerful hardware and  computing power to train and run. For that reason, the DeepSeek bombshell produced fears in investors. DeepSeek came to the party with a promise of having the capacity to offer cheaper models to obtain the same AI results. This possibility has made investors wonder if DeepSeek appeared to pop the Nvidia AI bubble. Cheaper models does not necessarily mean less money for Nvidia because quicker widespread AI adoption could mean more demand for Nvidia’s GPUs as more data centers are needed. The positive possibility for Nvidia would be based on the Jevons Paradox, a concept in economics, that occurs when the cost of using a resource drops (Nvidia’s GPUs in this case), and the overall demand increases (more people and companies massively buying Nvidia’s GPUs), causing total resource consumption to rise. But investors do not seem to be seeing the Jevons Paradox in the appearance of DeepSeek to the AI race. Nvidia is in a challenging position that needs to be reverted for the company to stay as the leader in the AI revolution. Another challenge for Nvidia is the political landscape. With around 15% of Nvidia’s revenue coming from China, the possibility of an outright ban from China against Nvidia is not unthinkable. The numbers are confirming that there is a problem: Nvidia is no longer a $3 trillion company.</p><p>Berkshire Hathaway was not only downgraded from 9th to 10th richest company in the world, but it has maintained its stock price alarmingly flat since 28 Jan 2025. A flat trajectory is concerning because the competitors are serious in this race, and new companies could soon emerge as $1 trillion businesses. Currently, Hathaway is the “poorest” in the elite group of companies that have more than $1 trillion in market capitalization.</p><p>Larry Page had an impressive Friday making his net worth grow as his company, Alphabeth/Google reached an all-time high price that day. Alphabet is still the 4th richest company in the world and at this pace it may soon join the exclusive group of the top three companies with a market capitalization higher than $3 trillion (currently Alphabet is at $2.5 trillion). Page remains as the 6th richest person in the world.</p><p>The hopes for Bernard Arnault that the bad situation of his company in 2024 had ended, could be lost with the results suffered by his company this week. 2025 had been great for his company but everything changed from Tue, 28 Jan 2025. With those results, 2025 does not seem to be the promising year for LVMH and Arnault. It is a big question mark what the year will bring to the company and his head, Arnault. The richest man in Europe is again in the headlines with negative press.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 4:54 AM GMT · 1 Feb 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
