Broadcom back on track to growth. Google richer than Amazon again. Ellison had a great day of growth. Ortega richer than Ballmer.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/01/31/01/18/img/20250131-0118-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250131-0118-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>Microsoft's Q2 earnings report resulted in its stock suffering a fall, with the Microsoft Azure cloud revenue missing expectations.</p><p>Broadcom is recovering from its stock price dramatic fall that happened Mon, 27 Jan 2025. After that the company has been again in a trajectory of growth, maintaining Broadcom in a position of a key player in the artificial intelligence developments.</p><p>The drama in the race between Google and Amazon continues. Last 23 Jan 2025, Amazon became richer than Google but that position only lasted a few days for Amazon because Google is back ahead of Amazon in the place of the 4th richest company in the world. However, the difference is only $2.469 trillions (Google) versus $2.467 trillions (Amazon). Anything can happen the next day and in the next few weeks and months. The race continues and it is difficult to know which company will be consolidated as the winner for a solid and long period of time.</p><p>Larry Ellison made his net worth grow on Thursday with his company, Oracle, having an impressive day of growth in the stock market moving from $162.02 to $170.38 for the price.</p><p>Steve Ballmer went one spot down in the ranking of richest people in the world after Amancio Ortega, the richest person in Spain, took the 9th position from him. Ballmer went from 9th to 10th. Microsoft had a disappointing day in the stock market on Thursday, and that was reflected in Ballmer’s net worth position. Ortega is having an impressive 2025 in the rankings.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 1:18 AM GMT · Jan 31, 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
