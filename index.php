Meta finding it difficult to be apolitical.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/01/13/14/00/img/20250113-1400-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250113-1400-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>Regarding the last-minute rush by the Biden administration to issue new regulations over artificial-intelligence technology, Ned Finkle, Nvidia’s vice president of government affairs, has said: “In its last days in office, the Biden Administration seeks to undermine America’s leadership with a 200+ page regulatory morass, drafted in secret and without proper legislative review. This sweeping overreach would impose bureaucratic control over how America’s leading semiconductors, computers, systems, and even software are designed and marketed globally.” Nvidia’s shares have been falling since January 7th. This is adding insult to injury because technology stocks have been hit in recent days after U.S. jobs data have made it less likely that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates soon.</p><p>On the episode number 2255 of “The Joe Rogan Experience”, corresponding to January 10th, 2025, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said: \"Basically, these people from the Biden administration would call up our team and, like, scream at them and curse.\" Apparently, it is becoming difficult for Meta to stay apolitical as the new U.S. Government administration has its inauguration this month. For now, investors would be observing the evolution of affairs but Meta seems to have a solid beginning of the year in terms of growth and expectations for its stocks future.</p></div><div>Published: 2:00 PM GMT · Jan 13, 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
