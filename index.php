Page experiencing significant losses. Finally positive results for Nvidia after DeepSeek shock. TSMC richer than Berkshire Hathaway. Ellison making his net worth grow.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/02/06/00/00/img/20250206-0000-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250206-0000-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>With a stock price of $193.30, Alphabet has lost almost all progress the company had made in 2025. On 1 Jan 2025, the price was $190.63. On 3 Feb 2025, the price had reached a value of $207.71. The decline started with the report of Alphabet's fourth-quarter results, which was not received as good news by investors. Shareholders had anticipated a much better performance for Google Cloud revenue, resulting in disappointment and a dramatic fall for Alphabet’s stock price. As expected, Larry Page suffered significant losses in his net worth, with a reduction of $11.4 billion in one day.</p><p>Nvidia had an outstanding stock performance on Wednesday. China's DeepSeek brought fears to Nvidia investors who thought about the possibility that Nvidia's expensive AI chips would no longer be core to sustain the engine of the AI revolution. Nonetheless, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft are expecting to spend billions of dollars in 2025, suggesting that the race for artificial intelligence power is going to continue and Nvidia AI chips will continue to have a high demand. This may have helped to give confidence to investors, and forget for now about the DeepSeek threats.</p><p>TSMC is now richer than Berkshire Hathaway, with $1.081 and $1.022 trillion dollars for each company, respectively, in market capitalization. TSMC is not the 10th richest company in the world, while Berkshire Hathaway is number 11.</p><p>Larry Ellison had a positive Wednesday to help with keeping his net worth in a solid position as the 4th richest person in the world. His company, Oracle, has had ups and downs this year, but it is overall growing in the stock market.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 0:00 AM GMT · 6 Feb 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
