Amazon richer than Google again. Meta’s 70% stock surge in 2024. Tesla losing traction. Musk in volatile environment. Huang benefiting from AI hype.</a></h2><div><img src=\"/opinion/2025/01/02/16/02/img/20250102-1602-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250102-1602-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>From the elite group of the Magnificent 7 Stocks, GOOG has the lowest Price-to-Earnings value. That means that Alphabet holds a reasonable price tag. The participation of the company in artificial intelligence (AI) with Google Gemini, and the Vertex AI Platform, is promising a strong 2025 in terms of revenue and earnings growth. Nonetheless, Alphabet in the short term is not competing to become the richest company in the world, but to prove that it is better than Amazon, which has again surpassed Alphabet in market capitalization.</p><p>Meta’s 70% stock surge in 2024 is positive as the company maintains a vision of investment in AI technologies and opportunities for 2025.</p><p>The last week of 2024, and beginning of 2025 has been a rocky season for Tesla. The volatility of the company is well-known, but Tesla will have to change the negative pattern of the last few days to be back on track to the outstanding results that the company experienced in the last quarter of 2024. One question to answer is to what extent those outstanding results came from the United States election's high expectations about how the relationship between Trump and Musk could help Tesla’s future financial growth. The high volatility for Tesla and Musk is likely to continue as a new government administration takes charge in 2025.</p><p>Jensen Huang keeps making his net worth grow steadily alongside the AI hype that is not likely to stop in 2025.</p></div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
