Flat stock price for Broadcom since 10 Feb 2025.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/02/16/12/59/img/20250216-1259-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250216-1259-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>Nvidia finally has a positive 2025 balance, after a forgettable start to 2025. Nvidia’s stock price was $138.31 on 2 Feb 2025, and $138.35 on 14 Feb 2025. That is only 0.39% growth, in approximately one month and a half. It may seem like a modest increase. But considering how DeepSeek, the Chinese AI app, shocked the tech world around the end of January 2025, simply having a positive number for the stock price growth in 2025, could be seen as a relief for Nvidia. If the DeepSeek fears are something of the past, maybe Nvidia can have the rest of 2025, moving forward, to grow and impress investors the way they have seen the company thrive in the last 13 months.</p><p>Since Monday, 10 Feb 2025, Broadcom has kept a flat stock price. The U.S. stock markets will be closed on Monday, 17 Feb 2025, in observance of Washington's Birthday. Broadcom will have 4 days from Tuesday to Friday next week, to go back to the consistent pattern of consistent growth that the company had been experiencing from 28 January to 10 February 2025.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 12:59 PM GMT · 16 Feb 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
