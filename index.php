Amazon wealthier than Alphabet. Huang wealthier than Ballmer. Arnault the biggest billionaire loser of 2024 and starting 2025 in bad shape.</a></h2><div><img src=\"/opinion/2025/01/04/01/25/img/20250104-0125-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250104-0125-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>Apple stock has been falling since Dec. 27, 2024. The company still has the richest in the world crown, but the end of 2024 and beginning of 2025 has been downhill for Apple.</p><p>Tesla is showing why it has a Beta (5Y Monthly) of 2.30, which is high. A beta of 2.3 means a stock moves more than twice as much as the S&P 500. Tesla's stock has a high volatility. That explains why after a poor performance in the last few days, Tesla's stock closed Friday with outstanding results! It is like a rollercoaster.</p><p>in the world, but none of the companies is giving up the fight. Currently, Amazon is once again the winner, but only by a tiny amount. Anything can happen this year and it is difficult to predict which company will solidify its position as the winner.</p><p>Jensen Huang has not only had a formidable day making his wealth grow significantly, but now he surpassed Steve Ballmer who was downgraded to the tenth richest person, with Huang upgraded to number nine.</p><p>Bernard Arnault was the biggest billionaire loser of 2024, and 2025 has not started well for him. At this pace he may soon lose his position as the fifth richest man in the world.</p></div><div>Published: 1:25 AM GMT · Jan 4, 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
