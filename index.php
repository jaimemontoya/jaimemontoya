Meta avoiding hostility with the new USA administration. Arnault favored by not relying on the American stock market results.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/01/11/00/22/img/20250111-0022-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250111-0022-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>The statement this week by Nvidia’s CEO, saying that it would likely be somewhere between 15 to 30 years before there are \"very useful quantum computers\", may be another element in the list of items contributing to Nvidia having a poor day again in the stock market. Since January 7, 2025, the company’s stock price has been in decline. Not that quantum computers are core in the business model of Nvidia, but probably investors were expecting Nvidia to announce breakthroughs for 2025, such as great progress with the next-generation GPUs, or equivalent announcements to make investors excited about the short-term future (current quarter or year) for Nvidia. The Biden administration additional rules to control semiconductor exports for AI is likely to have made investors penalize Nvidia, resulting in a drop in its stock price.</p><p>Meta Platforms’ stock increased its price today showing positive results, being an outlier because the Nasdaq price went down on Friday. Adria R. Walker, reporting for The Guardian on Fri 10 Jan 2025 21.06 GMT, wrote that after ending fact checkings, now Meta is rolling back diversity initiatives, quoting how in an internal memo, Meta acknowledged that “the legal and policy landscape surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the United States is changing”. The Guardian’s report mentioned that the changes come in proximity to the United States President-elect’s 20 January inauguration, suggesting that the moves are part of a strategy to cozy up to the incoming administration. Meta does not seem to want a hostile relationship with the new government of the United States, and it seems to be taking radical steps this year. Investors seemed to favor Meta today and overall the company seems to be having a year of growth in 2025 for now.</p><p>Larry Ellison had a bad day for his financial growth. This was the result of his company’s negative stock results today after investors did not receive with excitement the robust job’s report provided by the Federal Reserve because it means that the probabilities that the Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates are in consequence reduced. This is part of the dynamics in the ongoing battle with inflation. Inflation has historically had an inverse relationship with unemployment. In other words, when inflation rises, unemployment drops. Since the Federal Report’s report suggests a drop in unemployment, that is a signal of a rise in inflation. And the Federal Reserve continues with its ongoing battle against inflation. If the Fed does not lower rates because inflation is rising, the response from investors is negative. Businesses are likely to limit their aggressive pursuit of growth under those conditions. Investors, expecting lower earnings ahead, may prefer not to funnel more capital into the stock market. Then stock prices are pushed lower. Ironically, the good news about a robust job report by the Fed, probably resulted in bad general results for the stock market today, in in the case of Ellison, a bad day as it added insult to injury the fact that the Biden administration added new regulations aimed at more strictly controlling exports of semiconductors for artificial intelligence (AI). Ellison’s company was negatively impacted by that because it participates in those areas.</p><p>Bernard Arnault had a positive day in his wealth growth. It helped that his company is in the European, not American stock market, so he was not vulnerable to the Federal Reserve robust job’s report that apparently affected Dow Jones, NASDAQ and S&P 500 today.</p></div><div>Published: 12:22 AM GMT · Jan 11, 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
