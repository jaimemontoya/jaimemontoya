This is a calm after the storm for Nvidia.</p><p>Berkshire Hathaway had a bad Tuesday with a price fall from $474.70 to $469.97.</p><p>Amancio Ortega does not seem to have come for a short visit to the top 10 list of richest people in the world. Apparently, he wants to stay, after entering that elite group on Monday, and having an outstanding Tuesday for his net worth. This is a great week for Ortega so far.</p><p>Bernard Arnault has interrupted the solid growth of his net worth, after the fall in the stock price of his company LVMH, on Tuesday. 2025 had been outstanding for the company, but on Tuesday the price went from $750.60 to $710.80. This was because the company’s end-of-year report disappointed investors. Arnault also lost his place as the 4th richest person on earth, and was downgraded to 5th.</p><p>Now Larry Ellison is the 4th richest person in the world, after a good day in the stock market for his company, Oracle.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 10:28 AM GMT · Jan 29, 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
