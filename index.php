Meta missed a growth opportunity.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/01/18/14/14/img/20250118-1414-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250118-1414-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>The semiconductor giant Broadcom Inc. had an impressive Friday in the stock market as a result of a price target boost by Thomas O'Malley, a Barclays Stock Analyst who made the estimation of a price target for Broadcom from $205 to $260. The current price is $237.44, but it went on Friday from $236.52 when the market opened, to $237.44 when the market closed. Since November 29, 2024, Broadcom has been in a pattern of explosive and consistent growth.</p><p>Meta Platforms, Inc. did not have a good Friday in terms of stock market performance because even though it experienced a little growth, it was almost flat when compared to all other elite companies in the top ten ranking of the wealthiest in the world. Meta did not grow proportionally to the growth experienced on Friday by the Dow Jones, NASDAQ and S&P 500, which makes the positive situation for the stock market on Friday, as a missed opportunity for Meta.</p></div><div>Published: 2:14 AM GMT · Jan 18, 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
