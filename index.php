Meta reconciling with Trump.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/01/12/04/23/img/20250112-0423-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250112-0423-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>Nvidia used firm and strong words to criticize the reported Biden plan for Artificial Intelligence chips to limit exports to countries that are not U.S. allies. Nvidia Vice President Ned Finkle said by email: \"We would encourage President Biden to not preempt incoming President Trump by enacting a policy that will only harm the U.S. economy, set America back, and play into the hands of U.S. adversaries,\". Finkle also added: \"This last-minute Biden administration policy would be a legacy that will be criticized by U.S. industry and the global community,\". Nvidia reached a stock price of $149.43 on January 6, 2025, the greatest for a day in the last year. Nvidia’s 52-week high is $153.13. But from January 7 to now, its stock performance has been going downhill.</p><p>Meta seems to be realigning its relationship with the incoming U.S. President. Last month, Meta said it would be donating $1 million to Trump's inauguration. In January 2025, Kaplan was announced as the new president of global affairs of Meta Platforms starting from the Spring 2025. Kaplan served eight years in the administration of Republican President George W. Bush. Trump has called Facebook \"the enemy of the people\" and wrote in his book “Save America” that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg plotted against him during the 2020 election, adding that the Facebook founder would “spend the rest of his life in prison” if he did it again. Facebook and Meta's Instagram suspended Trump's accounts for two years in 2021 as a consequence of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol. The context clearly reveals a historically hostile relationship between Meta/Zuckerberg and Trump. The donation for Trump’s inauguration, nomination of Kaplan as president of global affairs, and 2025 Zuckerberg meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, reveal an apparent “reconciliation” in the relationship between Zuckerberg and Trump. Zuckerberg even parked his private jet right next to Trump Force One during the visit to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago luxury resort club and national historic landmark in Palm Beach, Florida. The current situation and how things have started in 2025 seems to suggest that Meta and the new U.S. government administration will not work in hostility, which may be positive news for Meta investors.</p></div><div>Published: 4:23 AM GMT · Jan 12, 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
