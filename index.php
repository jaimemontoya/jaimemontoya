Amazon had a terrible Friday. Zuckerberg richer than Bezos. Ellison solidifying his position as 4th richest person. Buffett richer than Brin.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/02/08/00/02/img/20250208-0002-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250208-0002-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>Since Tue, 4 Feb 2025, Nvidia has been experiencing solid and consistent growth in the stock market. The fears about Chinese startup DeepSeek and its LLM do not seem to be driving investors to abandon their confidence in the future of Nvidia in the AI revolution.</p><p>Amazon shares dropped Friday more than 4%. The weaker-than-expected sales forecast was one of the main reasons for investors to react this way, even though the 2024 numbers for Amazon were overall solid. As a result of the poor Friday performance for Amazon, Jeff Bezos was downgraded to 3rd richest person in the world, replaced by Mark Zuckerberg in the 2nd place.</p><p>Oracle has been enjoying growth in its stock price since 28 Jan 2025, with the company almost reaching half trillion dollars in market capitalization. Larry Ellison is benefiting from those results and solidifying his position as the 4th richest person in the world.</p><p>Warren Buffett did not have a particularly outstanding Friday for his company, Berkshire Hathaway, but he still improved his position in the ranking of richest people from 8th to 7th. That was because Alphabet had a particularly bad Friday in the stock market, resulting in Sergey Brin losing $4.5 billion in one day. Brin is no longer number 7, but the 8th richest person on earth.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 0:02 AM GMT · 8 Feb 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
