Zuckerberg the third richest person. Ellison no longer in the top 3. Musk’s net worth decreased today. Nvidia almost reaching the top again. Poor performance day for Tesla. Huang at CES 2025.</a></h2><div><img src=\"/opinion/2025/01/06/20/07/img/20250106-2007-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250106-2007-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>Google is again the fourth richest company in the world, after surpassing Amazon today. Both companies have been fighting for that position to become the next in line behind the top three companies in the world. It is still difficult to predict which of those companies will win the race but for now the winner is Google.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg is officially the third richest person in the world after taking that position from Larry Ellison today. The 40-year-old CEO of Meta is the youngest person in the elite list of top billionaires. At this pace he may one day become the richest man on earth.</p><p>Elon Musk’s wealth decreased today, since his company has a high volatility in the stock market. But what keeps him still solid as the number one richest person is the extremely large difference he still has versus the rest of billionaires. It is not clear how successful 2025 will be for him to remain as number one.</p><p>Larry Ellison is no longer in the top 3 of the richest men on the planet. His company is number 20 in the wealthiest ranking, and Ellison may not be able to stay in the top 3 of the richest people if his company does not make it to the top 10 list.</p><p>As expected, Nvidia's official keynote address at this year's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas was positive for the stock of the company and Nvidia is again, closer to take the crown of richest company on earth one more time, as happened a few times in 2024. The future seems promising for Nvidia in the IA revolution era.</p><p>Tesla did not have a good day in the stock market on Monday. The company remains a roller coaster in volatility. The global EV sector has new competitors and China has the potential to outpace the west in the shift to electric vehicles.</p><p>Jensen Huang is in the spotlight taking center stage at CES 2025. He is a celebrity in the AI revolution and his wealth keeps growing at a rapid pace.</p></div><div>Published: 8:07 PM GMT · Jan 6, 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
