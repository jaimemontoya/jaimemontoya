Meta in makeover season.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/01/20/15/07/img/20250120-1507-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250120-1507-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>The Artificial Intelligence wars have already started and Broadcom had a fantastic December 2024, raising momentum as a leader in application-specific integrated circuits used in artificial intelligence.</p><p>Meta’s makeover continues in a context of political controversy. President Biden criticized Zuckerberg’s decision to abandon fact-checking on Facebook, judging the decision as “shameful.” Zuckerberg recently met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and later donated $1 million to the president-elect’s inaugural day. The transition that Facebook is experiencing could be seen as some kind of identity crisis. More than seven years ago, Zuckerberg wrote: “Trump says Facebook is against him. Liberals say we helped Trump. Both sides are upset about ideas and content they don’t like. That’s what running a platform for all ideas looks like.” In a Tweet from Sep 27, 2017, Trump said: “Facebook was always anti-Trump.The Networks were always anti-Trump hence,Fake News, @nytimes (apologized) & @WaPo were anti-Trump. Collusion?” It is uncertain whether or not aligning with Trump for this new presidential term will be beneficial for Meta’s stock. The results of the first 20 days of the year for Facebook do not give a clear picture for what to expect for 2025, and the stock successful future for Meta is still a big question mark. </p></div><div>Published: 3:07 PM GMT · Jan 20, 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
