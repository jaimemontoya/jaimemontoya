Zuckerberg running for top positions in ranking of wealthiest people. Tesla with bad performance since Trump started his second term. Musk needing to has his company back on track to outstanding results.</a></h2><div class=\"floatleft\"><img src=\"/opinion/2025/01/24/04/43/img/20250124-0443-collage.jpg\" alt=\"20250124-0443-collage\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"floatleft\"><p>Meta has been in a pattern of stock price growth since 15 Jan 2025. Thursday was a great day for Meta with a price of $627.50 when the market opened, and $636.45 when it closed, resulting in a 2.08% increase relative to the previous day. The $636.45 stock price of Meta is an all-time high at market close time (4:00 PM). This is great news for Zuckerberg, who continues in the running to become again one of the 3 richest people in the world. Currently he is number 4.</p><p>Since 21 Jan 2025, Tesla’s stock price has been in decline. Interestingly enough, Tesla has not had one positive day for its stock price, after Donald Trump officially started his new term as President of the United States, despite the excellent relationship between Elon Musk and Trump. Musk’s fortune is still gigantic, but with Tesla having a couple of bad days in the stock market, Musk loses a couple of billions in his net worth.</p></div><div>Published: 4:43 PM GMT · Jan 24, 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
