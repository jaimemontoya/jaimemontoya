Huang may have missed an important detail in his speech. Nvidia had a big fall after a record high. Arnault is growing again.

Today he surpassed Jensen Huang who was downgraded from the 9th to the 10th position. Huang suffered the results of Nvidia's poor performance today in the stock market. The bad results could be attributed partially to the lack of detail on Rubin, Nvidia's next generation of graphics processing units (GPUs). That theory believes that the CES speech on Monday by Jensen Huang missed to provide information related to the company's progress with Rubin, its future GPU. The zero mention of Rubin may have alarmed investors. The result has been one of the craziest reversals for Nvidia, from hitting a 52-week high on the same day it closed with a dramatic fall. In other words, when the market opened at 9:30 AM New York time, the price of Nvidia stock was at a record high of $152.20. When the market closed at 4:00 PM, Nvidia’s stock price was $140.14.</p><p>Bernard Arnault, the French luxury magnate, is starting to have positive results during the last couple of days of the year, after the poor performance in his 2024 numbers.</p><p>Berkshire Hathaway was the only company in the richest top 10, experiencing a positive price change as compared to yesterday, signaling a bad day in the stock market, but still a positive day for Berkshire Hathaway as an outlier.</p></div><div>Published: 3:34 AM GMT · Jan 8, 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
