With a price to earnings ratio of 16.52, dramatically lower than the ratio of all of the top technology companies, it suggests a cheap price that may rise in the future. The company has managed to stay firmly as the 6th richest company in the world, with a low volatility and the apparent potential to stay among the best and the greatest in 2025.</p><p>Meta Platforms’ stock has experienced a decline in the last couple of days. The European Commission fined Meta for an amount of €798m over 'unfair' Facebook Marketplace. That happened in November 2024, when Meta was accused of having anti-competitive conditions on its listing service, Facebook Marketplace. Meta said in a blog post updated on January 8, 2025 at 3:00 AM PT: “While we disagree with and continue to appeal the European Commission’s decision on Facebook Marketplace, we are working quickly and constructively to build a solution which addresses the points raised. Today, we will launch a test in Germany, France, and the US that will enable buyers to browse listings from eBay directly on Facebook Marketplace while completing their transaction on eBay. This could benefit people using both platforms. eBay sellers will gain exposure to Facebook’s audience while people using Marketplace will be able to discover a broader array of listings from the eBay community.” Apparently Meta investors did not receive the news well, and Meta’s stock suffered a decline today.</p><p>Larry Ellison had positive results on Wednesday to increase his wealth and he does not seem to be willing to give up easily the position of third richest person in the world, which currently belongs to Meta’s CEO after Ellison lost it only a few days ago.</p><p>Bernard Arnault continues with his roller coaster performance in 2025, and today was a day at the bottom for him, decreasing his wealth more than any other person from the elite list of billionaires.</p></div><div>Published: 2:54 AM GMT · Jan 9, 2025</div><a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com/opinion/\">Richest companies and people since 2024-Dec-21, including Jaime Montoya's stock market, business & finance opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT</a></p><div id=\"richest-company\"></div><div id=\"richest-people\"></div><div id=\"jaime-montoya-capital\"></div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ol><li><a href=\"about/\">About</a>: My one-page resume.<li><a href=\"blog/\">Blog</a>: Software technical documentation blog for myself and the world.<li><a href=\"book/\">Book reviews</a>: My reviews for some of the books I have read from cover to cover.<li><a href=\"capital/\">Capital</a>: Capital history in my records since May 5, 2024.<li><a href=\"coursera/\">Coursera</a>: Coursera courses I have successfully completed.<li><a href=\"finances/\">Finances</a>: Personal finance software I have created.<li><a href=\"investment\">Investment</a>: Mutual fund and stock investments I have made since April 12, 2024.<li><a href=\"news/\">News</a>: Personal news since November 7, 2024, 00:00 AM GMT.<li><a href=\"opinion/\">Opinion</a>: Stock Market, Business & Finance Opinion since 2024-Dec-30 9:47 PM GMT.<li><a href=\"portfolio/\">Portfolio</a>: Websites I have created, designed, developed, upgraded, maintained and/or hosted.<li><a href=\"reading/\">Reading</a>: Listing all of the books I have read from cover to cover since August 31, 2018.<li><a href=\"run/\">Running</a>: Running history I have endured since August 2, 2020.<li><a href=\"teaching/\">Teaching</a>: In-person classes I have taught.<li><a href=\"weight/\">Weight</a>: Weight history from my body since October 19, 2019.</ol></p>";
