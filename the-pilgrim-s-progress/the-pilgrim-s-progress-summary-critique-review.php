				<p>As Christian and Faithful were walking to the Celestial City, they arrived at a town called Vanity, a place of never ending festivities. Lusts, pleasures and all kinds of delights could be purchased in that town. It was impossible to reach the Celestial City without going through Vanity in the journey for those who were alive. Even the King of Kings had to pass through Vanity, when he was invited by Beelzebub to buy vanities.</p>
				<p>Christian and Faithful entered the fair in Vanity, disturbing the town because they were different than those at the fair in three ways: their attire, speech, and and the value they placed on the merchandise being sold.</p>
				<p>Merchants at Vanity Fair despised and mocked Christian and Faithful. As a result, there was a great uproar that escalated to an interrogation where the governor of the fair had to intervene. While being investigated, Christian and Faithful stated that they were innocent from the accusations. Even after being beaten, publicly mocked and put into a cage, Christian and Faithful blessed their perpetrators. They were humble and patient.</p>
				<p>Evangelist had prophecied that Faithful or Christian would die, but they did not know who of them would suffer that fate. They remained content and commited to be wise in any circumstance.</p>
				<p>Envy, Superstition, and Flatterer testified against Faithful, while he provided arguments against the accusations. The judge quoted stories of Pharaon the Great and Nebuchadnezzar the Great to explain that Faithful had broken laws, deserving to die. The jury members anonymously concluded that Faithful was guilty. Faithful was executed.</p>
				<p>Immediately after dying, Faithful was taken through the clouds by a chariot and a team of hourses, to the Celestial Gate.</p>
				<p>Christian remained in prison after Faithful died, but eventually was able to escape to continue his journey to the Celestial City.</p>
