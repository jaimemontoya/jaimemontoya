It could not have been more dramatic. The fall started on Mon, 28 Jan 2025. To understand the contrast, Broadcom’s stock price on Fri, 24 Jan 2025 at 8:00 PM EST was $244.21. Mon, 28 Jan 2025 at 1:30 PM, the stock price was $196.80. The market at 4:00 PM when the market closed was $202.13. Monday was a nightmare for Broadcom’s stock. The fall had started to happen before the market opened on Monday because at 9:30 AM, the price was $211.97. The reason? Concerns over the possible competition in the artificial intelligence arena, from Chinese AI startup company DeepSeek. Broadcom was downgraded to 10th richest company on earth, losing its 9th position on Monday.</p><p>Surprisingly, the news about DeepSeek developing a sophisticated AI model without the advanced chips used by U.S. models, resulted in stocks rising on Monday for Apple. That could have been counterintuitive because Apple has also been trying to participate in the AI space to be one of the pioneers in the AI industry, and it is an American company. But the news about DeepSeek's model gave some hope that Apple could build AI-capabilities into its devices in a less expensive way than originally thought. Apple is again the most valuable company in the world, a position that it had lost on 22 Jan 2025 when Nvidia became number one.</p><p>As a result of the terrible results for Nvidia in the stock market originated by the news related to DeepSeek, Microsoft is now the second most valuable company in the world, only behind Apple. It is historic to see two iconic companies again fighting for the crown of being the richest on earth.</p><p>Berkshire Hathaway has been in a pattern of stock growth since 24 Jan 2025. The company started the year with a stock price of $451.10 and now the price is $474.70, representing a growth of 5.23% in 2025. Great performance for a company that is now the 9th richest in the world, replacing Broadcom after the massive loss it had on Monday.</p><p>Larry Ellison was one of the most affected in the list of top billionaires, by the news of DeepSeek, the Chinese AI startup. That is because Oracle was one of the top players from the American side, in the AI revolution. As expected, Oracle also experienced massive losses on Monday, affecting Ellison’s net worth. Ellison is no longer in the top 3 of wealthiest people in the world. He is now number 5 overnight! It is unusual to lose 2 spots in the ranking or the elite richest people, but his massive losses today as a result of the DeepSeek news, made Ellison one of the victims of the earthquake in the market that the Chinese AI company has created.</p><p>Bernard Arnault, by being outside of the American stock market, was not vulnerable to the dramatic fall that resulted from the emergence of DeepSeek. The American stock market in the area of technology was shocked by the DeepSeek news, and Arnault made his fortune grow in the meantime. The stock price of his company LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE has been growing in a consistent and strong way since 16 Jan 2025. Arnault is now the 4th richest person in the world, advancing one spot from its previously 5th position.</p><p>On Fri, 24 Jan 2025, Mark Zuckerberg said that “Llama 4 will become the leading state of the art model, and we'll build an AI engineer that will start contributing increasing amounts of code to our R&D efforts.” Since 15 Jan 2025, Meta’s stock has been in a solid direction of growth and surprisingly, the news about DeepSeek did not seem to negatively affect Meta on Monday. Zuckerberg is not the 3rd richest person on earth, replacing Larry Ellison.</p><p>Amancio Ortega is back to the ranking of the 10 richest people in the world, a position he had lost on 16 Jan 2025 when the tech AI titan Jensen Huang lost and very quickly reclaimed that spot. Interestingly enough, Ortega replaced Huang again in that 10th position, only 12 days later. The DeepSeek waves did not affect Zara and now Ortega is in a privileged position, with his empire growing and his personal fortune challenging even high-tech billionaires.</p><p>Jensen Huang had a record breaking loss! He was the 10th richest person in the world, and with the massive losses that Nvidia experienced on Monday, he was downgraded to number 17th. The list of people who are now ahead of him with a greater net worth, other than Amancio Ortega who took his position in the ranking, include: Rob Walton & family, Jim Waltom & family, Bill Gates, Alice Walton, Michael Dell, and Michael Bloomberg. Nvidia stock was hurt deeply by the DeepSeek news, resulting in the Nvidia stock losing nearly $600 billion, becoming by far the biggest market loss in history! Adding insult to injury, on Monday Nvidia lost its position as the world’s most valuable company, moving from 1st to 3rd in the ranking. It was a cataclysmic earthquake in the stock market for American companies related to the AI industry. DeepSeek, a Chinese startup, has been able to shake the market in historic ways.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 8:11 AM GMT · Jan 28, 2025</div>\n";
