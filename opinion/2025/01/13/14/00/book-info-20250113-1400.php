This sweeping overreach would impose bureaucratic control over how America’s leading semiconductors, computers, systems, and even software are designed and marketed globally.” Nvidia’s shares have been falling since January 7th. This is adding insult to injury because technology stocks have been hit in recent days after U.S. jobs data have made it less likely that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates soon.</p><p>On the episode number 2255 of “The Joe Rogan Experience”, corresponding to January 10th, 2025, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said: \"Basically, these people from the Biden administration would call up our team and, like, scream at them and curse.\" Apparently, it is becoming difficult for Meta to stay apolitical as the new U.S. Government administration has its inauguration this month. For now, investors would be observing the evolution of affairs but Meta seems to have a solid beginning of the year in terms of growth and expectations for its stocks future.</p></div><div>Published: 2:00 PM GMT · Jan 13, 2025</div>\n";
