He presented it as “the largest AI infrastructure project by far in history”. The Stargate's infrastructure spending is likely to result in immediate and significant profits for Nvidia.</p><p>Tesla continues with a mediocre stock performance since 16 January 2025. This has even raised concerns about the bullish long-term future for Tesla, with questions and statements such as, “has a 2025 Tesla stock crash already started?”</p><p>Warren Buffett has a company whose market capitalization is again below the $1 trillion mark. Buffet is still the 8th richest person in the world, but the strong challengers that he has behind can soon catch up if Buffet does not continue to make significant growth this year for his net worth.</p><p>Larry Ellison has been receiving a rain of good news for his net worth as his company, Oracle, is one of the big winners of Project Stargate, unveiled by President Donald Trump. Larry Ellison was even present at the White House for this announcement. Trump signed an executive order loosening regulations on the AI industry and reverting Biden’s rules in that area. That was a direct boost for Oracle’s stock. Ellison is now consolidated as the 3rd richest person in the world.</p><p>The race between Amazon and Google continues to take the position of 4th richest company in the world. That spot officially belongs again to Amazon. It was on 6 January 2025 that Google became richer than Amazon, but now the situation is reverted again and Google remained in that position for just 2 weeks and 3 days. The race is likely to continue in 2025, but for now, Amazon is the winner and its next challenge is to catch up with the top 3 richest companies, which currently are in another league all surpassing $3 trillion in market capitalization, while Amazon is at $2.47 trillion.</p></div><div>Published: 1:00 PM GMT · Jan 23, 2025</div>\n";
