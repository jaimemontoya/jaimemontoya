Thursday was a great day for Meta with a price of $627.50 when the market opened, and $636.45 when it closed, resulting in a 2.08% increase relative to the previous day. The $636.45 stock price of Meta is an all-time high at market close time (4:00 PM). This is great news for Zuckerberg, who continues in the running to become again one of the 3 richest people in the world. Currently he is number 4.</p><p>Since 21 Jan 2025, Tesla’s stock price has been in decline. Interestingly enough, Tesla has not had one positive day for its stock price, after Donald Trump officially started his new term as President of the United States, despite the excellent relationship between Elon Musk and Trump. Musk’s fortune is still gigantic, but with Tesla having a couple of bad days in the stock market, Musk loses a couple of billions in his net worth.</p></div><div>Published: 4:43 PM GMT · Jan 24, 2025</div>\n";
