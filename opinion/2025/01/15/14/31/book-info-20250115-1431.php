The good news is that January 15 started with growth when the market opened. Nonetheless, it remains unclear what 2025 will mean for the company as it is implementing critical changes in leadership and political statements as the U.S. makes a transition to a new government in less than a week from today.</p><p>Amancio Ortega, the richest person in Spain, who was the richest person in the world for a brief period of time in 2015, is back in the top ten of the ranking of richest people, with Jensen Huang being downgraded to 11th after the decline this year in the stock price of his company.</p><p>Bernard Arnault, the richest person in Europe, does not seem to be on track to become again the richest individual in the world. 2024 was a year of decline for the stock price of his company, and 2015 seems to be better so far, but still not having projections of steady growth.</p></div><div>Published: 2:31 PM GMT · Jan 15, 2025</div>\n";
