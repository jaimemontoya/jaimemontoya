With a price to earnings ratio of 16.52, dramatically lower than the ratio of all of the top technology companies, it suggests a cheap price that may rise in the future. The company has managed to stay firmly as the 6th richest company in the world, with a low volatility and the apparent potential to stay among the best and the greatest in 2025.</p><p>Meta Platforms’ stock has experienced a decline in the last couple of days. The European Commission fined Meta for an amount of €798m over 'unfair' Facebook Marketplace. That happened in November 2024, when Meta was accused of having anti-competitive conditions on its listing service, Facebook Marketplace. Meta said in a blog post updated on January 8, 2025 at 3:00 AM PT: “While we disagree with and continue to appeal the European Commission’s decision on Facebook Marketplace, we are working quickly and constructively to build a solution which addresses the points raised. Today, we will launch a test in Germany, France, and the US that will enable buyers to browse listings from eBay directly on Facebook Marketplace while completing their transaction on eBay. This could benefit people using both platforms. eBay sellers will gain exposure to Facebook’s audience while people using Marketplace will be able to discover a broader array of listings from the eBay community.” Apparently Meta investors did not receive the news well, and Meta’s stock suffered a decline today.</p><p>Larry Ellison had positive results on Wednesday to increase his wealth and he does not seem to be willing to give up easily the position of third richest person in the world, which currently belongs to Meta’s CEO after Ellison lost it only a few days ago.</p><p>Bernard Arnault continues with his roller coaster performance in 2025, and today was a day at the bottom for him, decreasing his wealth more than any other person from the elite list of billionaires.</p></div><div>Published: 2:54 AM GMT · Jan 9, 2025</div>\n";
