The current price is $237.44, but it went on Friday from $236.52 when the market opened, to $237.44 when the market closed. Since November 29, 2024, Broadcom has been in a pattern of explosive and consistent growth.</p><p>Meta Platforms, Inc. did not have a good Friday in terms of stock market performance because even though it experienced a little growth, it was almost flat when compared to all other elite companies in the top ten ranking of the wealthiest in the world. Meta did not grow proportionally to the growth experienced on Friday by the Dow Jones, NASDAQ and S&P 500, which makes the positive situation for the stock market on Friday, look as a missed opportunity for Meta.</p></div><div>Published: 2:14 AM GMT Â· Jan 18, 2025</div>\n";
