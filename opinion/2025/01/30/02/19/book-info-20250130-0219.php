The freefall in the company’s stock price experienced since the beginning of 2025 stopped on 21 Jan 2025 to keep results flat, and the growth has started since 27 Jan 2025.</p><p>Nvidia may have claimed victory too early when Tuesday seemed to be the calm after the heavy storm of Monday with the news of DeepSeek, a new startup competitor from China in the artificial intelligence race. But a new storm was restarted on Wednesday with alarming and poor results for Nvidia in the price of its stock. At this pace, Nvidia does not seem to be in good shape to obtain again the title of richest company in the world. Currently, Nvidia is number 3 and even on its way to be a company worth less than $3 trillion. In recent months and weeks Nvidia seemed to be in a realistic position to become the first company in the world to reach the historic $4 trillion mark in market capitalization. The situation has changed and now Nvidia needs to find the way to become again the headquarters of the artificial intelligence revolution, in a market environment where competition is fierce and Nvidia is no longer fighting for a monopoly, but for surviving to stay in the top of the ranking of the elite top 3 richest companies on the planet.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 2:19 AM GMT · Jan 30, 2025</div>\n";
