Both companies have been fighting for that position to become the next in line behind the top three companies in the world. It is still difficult to predict which of those companies will win the race but for now the winner is Google.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg is officially the third richest person in the world after taking that position from Larry Ellison today. The 40-year-old CEO of Meta is the youngest person in the elite list of top billionaires. At this pace he may one day become the richest person on earth.</p><p>Elon Musk’s wealth decreased today, since his company has a high volatility in the stock market. But what keeps him still solid as the number one richest person is the extremely large difference he still has versus the rest of billionaires. It is not clear how successful 2025 will be for him to remain as number one.</p><p>Larry Ellison is no longer in the top 3 of the richest people on the planet. His company is number 20 in the wealthiest ranking, and Ellison may not be able to stay in the top 3 of the richest people if his company does not make it to the top 10 list.</p><p>As expected, Nvidia's official keynote address at this year's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas was positive for the stock of the company and Nvidia is again, closer to take the crown of richest company on earth one more time, as happened a few times in 2024. The future seems promising for Nvidia in the IA revolution era.</p><p>Tesla did not have a good day in the stock market on Monday. The company remains a roller coaster in volatility. The global EV sector has new competitors and China has the potential to outpace the west in the shift to electric vehicles.</p><p>Jensen Huang is in the spotlight taking center stage at CES 2025. He is a celebrity in the AI revolution and his wealth keeps growing at a rapid pace.</p></div><div>Published: 8:07 PM GMT · Jan 6, 2025</div>\n";
