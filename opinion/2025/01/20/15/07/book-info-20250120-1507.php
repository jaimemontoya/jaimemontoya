President Biden criticized Zuckerberg’s decision to abandon fact-checking on Facebook, judging the decision as “shameful.” Zuckerberg recently met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and later donated $1 million to the president-elect’s inaugural day. The transition that Facebook is experiencing could be seen as some kind of identity crisis. More than seven years ago, Zuckerberg wrote: “Trump says Facebook is against him. Liberals say we helped Trump. Both sides are upset about ideas and content they don’t like. That’s what running a platform for all ideas looks like.” In a Tweet from Sep 27, 2017, Trump said: “Facebook was always anti-Trump.The Networks were always anti-Trump hence,Fake News, @nytimes (apologized) & @WaPo were anti-Trump. Collusion?” It is uncertain whether or not aligning with Trump for this new presidential term will be beneficial for Meta’s stock. The results in the first 20 years of the year are still a big question mark.</p></div><div>Published: 3:07 PM GMT · Jan 20, 2025</div>\n";
