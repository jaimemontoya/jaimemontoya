That pattern was reversed at the beginning of November 2024. However, it may be difficult for Aramco to remain as the sixth richest company in the world unless they experience stronger and more aggressive stock growth in the next few years.</p><p>The outstanding stock growth that Broadcom has had since the beginning of December 2024 does not seem to stop and the company has a bright future ahead. The success has been remarkable. Broadcom has experienced a massive expansion as a result of the demand for chips that power AI. The company was in the news when it hit the trillion dollar mark last year. Currently, Broadcom is one of the ten companies in the world whose market capitalization is above one trillion dollars.</p></div><div>Published: 12:04 AM GMT Â· Jan 19, 2025</div>\n";
