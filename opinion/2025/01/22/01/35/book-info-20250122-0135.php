The disappointing iPhone sales are hurting the financial situation of the company. The stock price for Apple went from $223.91 when the market opened, to $222.64 when it closed on Tuesday. The situation for Nvidia was the opposite, resulting in an outstanding stock price value that went from $139.23 when the market opened, to $140.80 when it closed. The problem for Apple is its weakness in China, where iPhone sales are in decline. Domestic rivals are getting momentum as Chinese consumers are in some kind of recession. Apple Intelligence is not being able to materialize in an upgrade cycle for Apple yet. Nvidia continues to shine bright and with Apple in bad shape at the moment, this could be the opportunity for Nvidia to keep consistently positive results and consolidate its position as the richest company in the world in a sustainable way, not as a title for Nvidia that lasts less than 24 hours, as it has happened in the past.</p><p>Elon Musk‚Äôs wealth has been stagnating since his company Tesla has not been able to experience any significant growth in its stock price since 15 Jan 2025. The first mover advantage is one of the elements that helped to create the massive that Tesla and Musk have today. Nonetheless, Tesla is no longer alone in its field. China's BYD overtook Tesla revenue for the first time in October 2024. Currently, Tesla has serious rivals. That means that the fortune of Musk may experience ongoing struggles if Tesla loses momentum in 2025.</p><p></p>The executive orders signed by President Trump on his first day in office have been amazing news for Larry Ellison, particularly because Donald Trump decided to delay for 75 days a controversial legal ban of the social media platform. On Jan 19, 2025, Elon Musk said: \"I have been against a TikTok ban for a long time, because it goes against freedom of speech. That said, the current situation where TikTok is allowed to operate in America, but ùïè is not allowed to operate in China is unbalanced. Something needs to change.\" Why did Trump‚Äôs executive order regarding TikTok, affect Oracle and consequently, Larry Ellison? Simply because Oracle has taken Trump at his word, and Oracle is the primary cloud provider of TikTok in the United States. Other companies such as Apple are taking a more cautious approach fearing expensive penalties for enabling TikTok on their platforms, which could result in significant amounts of money paid in fines, if Trump‚Äôs executive orders do not end up protecting the financial interest of the companies against fines. In addition, Trump‚Äôs executive orders reversed Biden's administration rules and regulations aimed at AI safety. This was positive for Oracle, since it is a direct participant in AI technologies. Oracle‚Äôs stock price had been negatively affected by Biden‚Äôs regulations for AI created just days before the end of his administration. As a result, Larry Ellison is again, the third richest person in the world.<p>It was on 6 January 2025 that Mark Zuckerberg took the position of third wealthiest person in the world from Larry Ellison, but now Zuckerberg lost and again Ellison is in the top 3. Zuckerberg could only keep the title for half a month.</p></div><div>Published: 1:35 PM GMT ¬∑ Jan 22, 2025</div>\n";
