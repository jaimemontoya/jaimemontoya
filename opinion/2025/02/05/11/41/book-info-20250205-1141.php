The price of its stock when the market opened at 8:30 AM was $204.51. When the market closed at 4:00 PM, the price was $207.71. Tuesday was an awesome day for Alphabet in the stock market! The answer is yes, if the day had ended at 4:00 PM. The problem was that Alphabet was scheduled to report its fourth-quarter results after the market closed Tuesday. Even though most analysts were bullish on Alphabeth’s stock, the results were disappointing in the view of investors. Google's cloud revenue did not meet the analysts' estimates and expectations. The antitrust probe launched by Chinese regulators against Google probably did not help the company, because now China is responding to the new U.S. tariffs and Google seems to be a target. At 5:30 PM, the stock price of Google was $191.51. That was a painful drop just 90 minutes after the market closed at 4:00 PM. It is fair to say that Google had an awesome Tuesday, but then it became a nightmare after the market closed. There was optimism before the report of Google’s fourth-quarter results.</p><p>Saudi Aramco may need to be more aggressive in its stock price growth strategy to remain in the elite list of the top richest companies in the world. It is true that Aramco is in the energy minerals sector, which is a defensive stock, normally stable regardless of the overall state of the stock market. But Aramco is in an elite league in terms of market capitalization, playing in a field next to the richest of the richest companies in the world. Without more aggressive growth, probably Aramco would soon be replaced by other companies and still be a wealthy company, but no longer part of the top 10 richest companies in the world.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 11:41 AM GMT · 5 Feb 2025</div>\n";
