		            <h2>Nvidia suffering investor’s fears. Broadcom with a more diversified portfolio in the AI race.</h2>
					<p>Broadcom is maintaining its dominant position in the AI race and revolution. It is interesting to observe how for now, Broadcom’s future still looks bright and it may have less public scrutiny and concerns than what Nvidia is experiencing regarding the fears after the emergence of the Chinese startup, DeepSeek. Part of the advantage of Broadcom might be that their business model is not exclusively relying on the AI market. Broadcom also offers mainframe software, virtual desktops (the acquisition of VMware was completed in late 2023), and AI-powered products. <mark>Published: 11:26 AM GMT · 3 Feb 2025</mark> <span class=\"underline white\">Read more</span> <i class=\"fa fa-link white\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></p>
