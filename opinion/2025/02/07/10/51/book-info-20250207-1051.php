Fears that companies will not need the same amount of computing power to fuel the AI revolution, resulted in scary news for Nvidia. Nonetheless, U.S. companies leading the AI race, do not seem to be focusing on reducing their spending to develop more efficient (cheaper in hardware infrastructure requirements) generative AI models. Contrary to that, their focus still seems to be on winning the race by creating the most powerful model possible, no matter how expensive it may be to achieve that goal. Mark Zuckerberg recognized that DeepSeek has made some “novel” innovations, but he made it clear that Meta still plans to have large capital expenditures in 2025. That was good news for Nvidia and its price in the stock market has been growing since Tue, 4 Feb 2025.</p><p>2025 has been a weak year for Tesla in the stock market, where its growth is negative. With lower than expected sales in Europe and the USA, and new competition overall, Tesla is having a difficult beginning of the year. Losing market share is a real threat for Tesla. The company is not really an AI and robotics company. That means that its core business is still the one of an automobile company. For that reason, the artificial intelligence revolution will not necessarily save Tesla from a decline if they do not improve their trends in the automotive industry. The business seems to be in decline and Elon Musk is suffering the consequences. His net worth at this pace may be below $400 billion soon. Unless Tesla develops surprising breakthroughs in 2025, the outlook for the company is not very promising. That statement is taking into account the elite league where Tesla is playing and considering that the company is measured against the standards of competition to become the richest company in the world.</p><p>Meta is having an extraordinary year with excellent stock price results and very importantly, consistency. Meta is growing at a solid pace in 2025, not in an erratic roller coaster pattern. That is promising for a company that is one of the leaders in the AI revolution. One critical element that is helping Meta is its healthy user growth for its family of apps (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp). Now Mark Zuckerberg is in a realistic position to become, in the short term, possibly even in February 2025, the second richest person in the world. Currently, he is number 3 in the ranking. Meta surpassed Saudi Aramco and now Meta is the 6th richest company in the world, downgrading Saudi Aramco to number 7.</p><p>TSMC is now richer than Broadcom in market capitalization (9th Vs. 10th richest, with TSMC taking the greater spot on Thursday). This is not a surprise considering that TSMC is producing around 90% of the most advanced processors. The AI revolution is likely to be playing in TSMC’s favor.</p><p>The great performance of Inditex in the stock market since 28 Jan 2025 has made Amancio Ortega surpass Steve Ballmer in net worth on Thursday, with 9th and 10th place, respectively for each of the billionaires in the ranking of richest people. It was on 2 Feb 2025 that Ballmer became richer than Ortega, and now the positions are reversed. As expected, the race between the two titans was going to be intense.</p><p>Nvidia is richer than Microsoft again. It was on 28 Jan 2025 when Microsoft became the 2nd richest company in the world, but the title only lasted a little longer than a week for Microsoft, and now Nvidia took back that position.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 10:51 AM GMT · 7 Feb 2025</div>\n";
