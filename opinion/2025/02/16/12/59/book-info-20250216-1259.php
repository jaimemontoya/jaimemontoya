Nvidia’s stock price was $138.31 on 2 Feb 2025, and $138.85 on 14 Feb 2025. That is only 0.39% growth, in approximately one month and a half. It may seem like a modest increase. But considering how DeepSeek, the Chinese AI app, shocked the tech world around the end of January 2025, simply having a positive number for the stock price growth in 2025, could be seen as a relief for Nvidia. If the DeepSeek fears are something of the past, maybe Nvidia can have the rest of 2025, moving forward, to grow and impress investors the way they have seen the company thrive in the last 13 months.</p><p>Since Monday, 10 Feb 2025, Broadcom has kept a flat stock price. The U.S. stock markets will be closed on Monday, 17 Feb 2025, in observance of Washington's Birthday. Broadcom will have 4 days from Tuesday to Friday next week, to go back to the consistent pattern of consistent growth that the company had been experiencing from 28 January to 10 February 2025.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 12:59 PM GMT · 16 Feb 2025</div>\n";
