The second inauguration of Donald Trump was also on Monday, January 20, 2025. It may be pure coincidence, but the timing may suggest possible connections between the two elements. This may seem counterintuitive because possibly, part of the optimism for Tesla’s stock at the beginning of 2025 (before the inauguration of the new President of the United States), was the relationship between Musk and Trump, and how that could benefit Tesla in the future. Nobody knows where things will go from here. But the reality is that since 20 Jan 2025, Tesla’s stock has been falling dramatically. 7 Feb 2024 was the last day when Elon Musk had more than $400 billion in his net worth. At this point Tesla may be banking on 2025 breakthroughs in the areas of self-driving taxis and robotics. The challenge now is that Tesla needs to materialize those projects with concrete executions, rather than only making promises for what will come somewhere in the near future.</p><p>Broadcom is now the 9th richest company in the world, replacing TSMC, which was downgraded to number 10. Broadcom had an outstanding beginning of the week in the stock market. Other than the dramatic fall around the end of January 2025, when DeepSeek headlines crushed the U.S. AI technology stocks, Broadcom has maintained solid results in 2025.</p><p>Oracle Corporation is another example of a technology company that has experienced an outstanding 2025 with positive results, except for the fall around January 2025 caused by the DeepSeek headlines. Overall, the future looks bright for the company because the growth opportunities it has in the AI revolution are terrific. Oracle is renting cloud infrastructure to train and deploy AI models. Larry Ellison is running at a solid pace towards the top 3 of the richest people in the world. Currently he is number 4 and he is running fast!</p><p>Warren Buffett was richer than Sergey Brin on 8 Feb 2025. Just 2 days later, the positions were reversed to the previous state, and again Brin is number 7, while Buffett is number 8 in the ranking of richest people in the world. The reality is that nothing special had happened for Buffett to win that spot 2 days ago. It was only the result of a bad day in the stock market for Alphabet. Berkshire Hathaway is one of the only 11 companies in the world that have more than $1 trillion in market capitalization, but currently, it is number 11 and having a difficult time competing to surpass the other 10 companies, almost all of them top high-technology companies.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 0:33 AM GMT · 11 Feb 2025</div>\n";
