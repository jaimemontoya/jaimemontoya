Around that time, Nvidia’s CFO stated: “We completed a successful mask change for Blackwell, our next Data Center architecture, that improved production yields. Blackwell production shipments are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and will continue to ramp into fiscal 2026 ... Both Hopper and Blackwell systems have certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026.” The Blackwell architecture is still highly profitable for Nvidia and its chips continue having a high demand.</p><p>For Amazon, Friday ended with disappointing results in the stock market, mainly because analysts expected higher target sales. The irony was that Amazon’s numbers for Q4 were strong. Nonetheless, investors and analysts seemed to be concerned about the unimpressive guidance for growth in 2025’s first quarter.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 12:19 AM GMT · 10 Feb 2025</div>\n";
