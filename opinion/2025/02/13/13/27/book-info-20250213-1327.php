The high volatility of the company is well-known. In the last few days, when seeing Tesla’s stock price in a pattern of freefall, the conversations were around how the proximity between Trump and Musk could be hurting Tesla’s brand. Wednesday seemed to contradict that theory, at least that day from the investor’s perspective. It is important to know that the market’s reaction cannot be oversimplified by attributing it to a single variable. The formula is complex. Another element that may have been positive for Tesla, ironically, is potential new electric vehicles sales taxes. That theory claims that Tesla is powerful enough to survive those taxes, while smaller competitors may be more price sensitive and potentially quit the race, or at least suffer significant financial difficulties that help Tesla keep the upper hand in electronic vehicles market share in the world. In other words, the potential of new taxes on sales of electric vehicles may be seen as bad for the short term, but positive in the long run, for Tesla. Maybe Wednesday has been the calm after the storm for Tesla. 2025 promises high volatility for the company. Tesla surpassed TSMC in market capitalization on Wednesday. Tesla advanced from 10th to 9th, while TSMC was downgraded from 9th to 10th, in the ranking of richest companies in the world. Tesla’s stock price freefall was interrupted on Wednesday, and that is at least good news and a relief for the company.</p><p>Wednesday was a day of poor performance for Amazon’s stock price. Is the reaction from investors justified, or are they overreacting? Amazon’s capital expenditures announcements for artificial intelligence in 2025 may have alarmed investors. Apparently, they are judging the 2025 forecast as unimpressive. The fact that artificial intelligence is a risky investment, makes investors' decision of pulling back a little, justifiable. The opportunity is immense, but the risks are also high. Amazon is serious about actively participating in the AI race. That will intrinsically cause volatility for the company.</p><p>Bernard Arnault is seeing his company LVMH recover from the stock price fall it experienced from 28 January to 5 February 2025. The results were generally flat after that, but Wednesday was a day of growth, which made Bernard’s net worth grow almost $5 billion in a day.</p><p>Larry Ellison lost $5 billion in his net worth on Wednesday. Both Tuesday and Wednesday were negative days for Oracle for its stock price. The company had surpassed $0.5 trillion in market capitalization on Mon, 10 Feb 2025. But after the Tuesday and Wednesday results, the company is again below the $0.5 trillion mark.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 1:27 PM GMT · 13 Feb 2025</div>\n";
