The fears about Chinese startup DeepSeek and its LLM do not seem to be driving investors to abandon their confidence in the future of Nvidia in the AI revolution.</p><p>Amazon shares dropped Friday more than 4%. The weaker-than-expected sales forecast was one of the main reasons for investors to react this way, even though the 2024 numbers for Amazon were overall solid. As a result of the poor Friday performance for Amazon, Jeff Bezos was downgraded to 3rd richest person in the world, replaced by Mark Zuckerberg in the 2nd place.</p><p>Oracle has been enjoying growth in its stock price since 28 Jan 2025, with the company almost reaching half trillion dollars in market capitalization. Larry Ellison is benefiting from those results and solidifying his position as the 4th richest person in the world.</p><p>Warren Buffett did not have a particularly outstanding Friday for his company, Berkshire Hathaway, but he still improved his position in the ranking of richest people from 8th to 7th. That was because Alphabet had a particularly bad Friday in the stock market, resulting in Sergey Brin losing $4.5 billion in one day. Brin is no longer number 7, but the 8th richest person on earth.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 0:02 AM GMT Â· 8 Feb 2025</div>

			   <p>The narrative focuses on wealth fluctuations tied to stock performance, neglecting the broader economic and social impacts of these companies' actions. For instance, Amazon's sales forecast might reflect shifting consumer behavior rather than inherent weakness, a trend mirrored by the recent surge in subscription-based services. How does this emphasis on individual wealth creation align with the growing discourse on equitable distribution of technological advancements?</p>
