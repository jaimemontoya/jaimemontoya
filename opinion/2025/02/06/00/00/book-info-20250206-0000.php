On 1 Jan 2025, the price was $190.63. On 3 Feb 2025, the price had reached a value of $207.71. The decline started with the report of Alphabet's fourth-quarter results, which was not received as good news by investors. Shareholders had anticipated a much better performance for Google Cloud revenue, resulting in disappointment and a dramatic fall for Alphabet’s stock price. As expected, Larry Page suffered significant losses in his net worth, with a reduction of $11.4 billion in one day.</p><p>Nvidia had an outstanding stock performance on Wednesday. China's DeepSeek brought fears to Nvidia investors who thought about the possibility that Nvidia's expensive AI chips would no longer be core to sustain the engine of the AI revolution. Nonetheless, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft are expecting to spend billions of dollars in 2025, suggesting that the race for artificial intelligence power is going to continue and Nvidia AI chips will continue to have a high demand. This may have helped to give confidence to investors, and forget for now about the DeepSeek threats.</p><p>TSMC is now richer than Berkshire Hathaway, with $1.081 and $1.022 trillion dollars for each company, respectively, in market capitalization. Now TSMC is the 10th richest company in the world, while Berkshire Hathaway is number 11.</p><p>Larry Ellison had a positive Wednesday to help with keeping his net worth in a solid position as the 4th richest person in the world. His company, Oracle, has had ups and downs this year, but it is overall growing in the stock market.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 0:00 AM GMT · 6 Feb 2025</div>\n";
