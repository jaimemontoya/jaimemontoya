Since the Tesla vehicles contain parts from Mexico and Canada, Tesla is not immune to tariffs. Canadian officials are in conversations to respond to Donald Trump in the form of retaliation against Trump and his allies. One of those allies is Ellon Musk, along with Republican-led states. The conversations in Canada were explicit to mention Musk and Tesla as targets of the retaliations. For example, Chrystia Freeland, the former Canadian finance minister, suggested a 100% tariff on Tesla vehicles. Doug Ford, the Ontario Premier, cancelled on behalf of the province contracts with Musk’s satellite company StarLink. Those are examples of retaliations targeting Musk and Tesla in a direct and explicit way. That is different from experiencing side-effects related to situations affecting an entire industry. In this context, it is not a surprise that Tesla had a remarkably bad day in the stock market, and Musk lost around $12 billion in one day. Overall, Monday was a bad day for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and Nasdaq in the stock market. It might not be an oversimplification to imagine that Donald Trump’s tariffs resulted in a reaction from investors to protect their money instead of investing aggressively in times of uncertainty.</p><p>Meta is running full speed and is unstoppable this year. Since the end of July 2024, the stock price of Meta has been growing at a solid pace. But the unstoppable exponential growth has been observed since approximately 15 Jan 2025. Mark Zuckerberg was an outlier on Monday making his net worth grow almost $3 billion when almost all other billionaire people in the elite of the ranking (top 10) lost money, considering that Monday was negative in the stock markets, possibly as a result of the news of Trump’s stiff tariffs.</p><p>The drama in the race between Amazon and Google continues. Google surpassed Amazon in wealth on 31 Jan 2025, but just 4 days later, Amazon is richer than Google again. For now Amazon is the winner. Both companies are fighting for the title of 4th richest company in the world. But none of them has been in recent weeks, in a realistic position to reach the top 3 in the ranking.</p></div><div class=\"clearboth\">Published: 1:22 PM GMT · 4 Feb 2025</div>\n";
