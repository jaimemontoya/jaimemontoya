His current primary role is to build Microsoft SSIS ETL packages to migrate data after the Republic Services' acquisition of US Ecology. Jaime believes that data analysis technologies provide an essential foundation for companies to make intelligent strategic decisions. While working for Applaudo Studios, Jaime collaborated with large teams of software developers to build big data ETL pipelines for Walmart Inc. using Scala-based technologies. In addition, he successfully completed three consecutive summer internships at Kodak Alaris building SSAS ETL packages and multi-dimensional cubes to deliver business intelligence and analytics solutions.</p><p>As an independent software developer, Jaime is using his technical skills to provide necessary upgrades, maintenance and improvements for the Cup&oacute;n Club Android app that is used by thousands of customers from Guatemala and El Salvador. In addition, Jaime is volunteering his web development technical skills to fix bugs and/or assist in the migration of electronic donation tools for the Salvadoran orphanage La Casa de Mi Padre. Jaime also donated the website for Union Church of San Salvador and is in charge of its development, updates and maintenance. Since January 18, 2023, Jaime has been building <a href=\"/montoya-money-manager/\" class=\"resetlink\">Montoya Money Manager</a>, an open source personal finance software to mimic the power of an OLAP cube, in this case designed to provide \"business intelligence\" (for individuals, not companies) applied to personal income and expenses.</p><p>Jaime received the prestigious Fulbright Foreign Student Program Scholarship. He completed a pre-academic Fulbright Intensive English Program at Loyola University Chicago. After that, Jaime graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology with a Master's degree in Information Sciences and Technologies. During his undergraduate studies in software systems engineering, Jaime was awarded the Global Undergraduate Exchange Program, a U.S. Department of State's exchange program, to study at the University of Alabama in Huntsville for one year. As part of his graduate studies, Jaime completed 16 credits towards a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Rochester, working as a Teaching Assistant for the course Database Systems.</p><p>The residence of Jaime is at Colonia Escal&oacute;n in San Salvador, El Salvador. He works fully remotely from his condominium apartment, enjoying the panoramic view of two high Salvadoran volcanoes, one lake in the distance, and the downtown area of San Salvador. Jaime enjoys reading electronic books on Kindle and O'Reilly Media. He uses courses from Coursera and O'Reilly Media for continuing education and Amazon Audible audiobooks to continuously grow in knowledge and as an individual. In his home page website at <a href=\"https://jaimemontoya.com\">https://jaimemontoya.com</a>, he provides a full reverse chronological list of books he has read, courses he has completed and audiobooks he has listened to. Each item is a link to a page were Jaime shows the words and phrases he has learned from that educational resource. That is his methodology to be a lifelong vocabulary learner. CBC Radio One 99.1 FM and CBC Television Toronto are Jaime's favorite radio and TV stations that he listens to and watches regularly. Jaime's favorite hobby is running. He has reached Purple Level in the Nike Run Club app after running 4,599 kilometers since August 3 2020 05:14:00 GMT. His running program has helped him to achieve a weight of 57.9 kg (127.6476 pounds) when this page was last updated (see below).</p><p>Jaime believes in the Bible as the Word of God. As a result, he confesses, acknowledges and declares that Jesus Christ is the Son of God (1 John 4:15). Since February 7, 2023, Jaime started an intensive, focused and time demanding mental, physical and spiritual training program prompted and inspired by his favorite passage in the Bible, 1 Corinthians 9:24-27 EXB: \"24 You [Don't you…?] know that in a race [stadium] all the runners run, but only one gets the prize. So run to win! 25 All those who compete in the games use self-control [train with strict discipline] so they can win a crown [victor's wreath]. That crown [victor's wreath] is an earthly thing that lasts only a short time [perishable], but our crown will never be destroyed [is imperishable]. 26 So I do not run without a goal [aimlessly]. I fight like a boxer who is hitting something—not just the air. 27 I treat my body hard [discipline/subdue/pummel my body] and make it my slave [subdue it] so that I myself will not be disqualified after I have preached to others.\" In the bullets below, I have my two favorite quotes related to hard work and self-discipline that were originally written with human greatness and achievement in mind. Nonetheless, they serve as quintessential ilustrations of the profound Biblical principle taught in 1 Corinthians 9:24-27. Achieving mental and physical excellence requires extremely hard work, intense focus and self-discipline. For example, the cost involved in obtaining a university degree is high in terms of years of study, effort, financial cost, and all kinds of sacrifices. Similarly, an athlete must endure and be disciplined to win and achieve greatness in competition. In the same way and even beyond that, because what is at stake and the prize is eternal and much more important, Christian life is supposed to be difficult. Challenges, pain, hardships should not surprise us (1 Peter 4:12) but we should expect that as part of God's work and loving training program in Christians, disciplining and helping them to mature and grow spiritually. Being a Christian requires self-control (offered by God as a fruit of the Holy Spirit in Galatians 5:22), and in the most extreme cases, death as a martyr (see Hebrews 11, Matthew 6:24, Acts 7:54-60, Matthew 10:37-39, Matthew 7:13-14).</p><ul><li>Spaniard Pablo de Sarasate, internationally acclaimed as the greatest violinist of the nineteenth century, was once called a genius by a famous critic. In reply to this Sarasate said, \"Genius! For 37 years I've practiced 14 hours a day, and now they call me a genius.\"<li>Philostratus the Elder wrote in the 2nd - 3rd Century AD:  \"If you have worked hard enough to render yourself worthy of going to Olympia, if you have not been idle or ill-disciplined, then go with confidence; but those who have not trained in this fashion, let them go where they will.\"</ul><p>Last updated: ".date("F d Y H:i:s.",filemtime("about-info.php"))."
