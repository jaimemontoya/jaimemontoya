				<h2 id=\"purpose-of-biblical-genealogies\">Purpose of biblical genealogies</h2>
				<p>Geoghegan & Homan (2003) explain the purpose and meaning of biblical genealogies:</p>
				<p class=\"quote\">The First (of Many) Biblical Genealogies (Genesis 5)</p>
				<p class=\"quote\">WARNING. In Genesis 5, you encounter what is perhaps one of the most vicious, merciless creatures in the entire Bible. We refer, of course, to the dreaded \"who begat whom\" lists. Actually, you come across these genealogical monsters not only in Genesis 5, but in many places throughout the Bible, leading people to ask, \"Why would the biblical authors waste so much precious space on such trivialities?\" And perhaps more importantly, \"Should I read them?\"</p>
				<p class=\"quote\">TECHNICAL STUFF. The reason the Bible preserves so many genealogies is because in ancient Israel (as in many cultures both then and now), family lineage or clan affiliation is essential for knowing one's place in the world. This concept is most obvious in the case of royalty, where one's connection to the royal family can produce significant benefits (or, in the case of certain royal families, significant detriments). In ancient Israel, the priesthood was also hereditary, as were inheritance rights and territorial claims. Therefore, careful preservation of one's family line was essential for securing rights and wealth for oneself and one's descendants.</p>
				<p class=\"quote\">Beyond their value for ancient Israel, the Bible's genealogies sometimes convey important information about the biblical authors' beliefs and values. For example, in Genesis 5, amidst all the \"who begat whoms,\" we read:</p>
				<p class=\"quote italic\">When Enoch had lived 65 years, he became the father of Methuselah. Enoch walked with God after the birth of Methuselah for 300 years, and had other sons and daughters. Thus, all the days of Enoch were 365 years. Enoch walked with God, and then he was no more, because God took him.</p>
				<p class=\"quote\">-GENESIS 5:21-24</p>
				<p class=\"quote\">Most interpreters understand the notice that \"Enoch walked with God\" to be a euphemism for \"having a close relationship with\" and \"obeying\" God. That is, the purpose of this particular genealogical notice is to make a theological point: God rewards those who seek to know Him and do what He commands. So what is Enoch's reward? Although some scholars have suggested that \"God took him\" simply means that Enoch died (hardly a reward for walking with God), most scholars agree that this phrase means that Enoch went to heaven. (In Trek-talk, God \"beamed him up.\") (chap. 4)</p>
				<p>Since the Old Testament included prophecies about the Saviour, one of the special uses of genealogies in the Scripture is \"for the clearing of the pedigrees of the Messiah\" (Henry, 1811, 1 Chronicles 1).</p>
				<h2 id=\"why-an-entire-chapter-given-to-esau-s-descendants\">Why an entire chapter given to Esau's descendants? (36:1-43)</h2>
				<p>Henry (1811) provides three reasons to keep a register of Esau's family in Genesis 36:</p>
				<ol class=\"quote\">
					<li>Because he was the son of Isaac, for whose sake this honour is put upon him.
					<li>Because the Edomites were neighbours to Israel, and their genealogy would be of use to give light to the following stories of what passed between them.
					<li>It is to show the performance of the promise to Abraham, that he should be \"the father of many nations,\" and of that answer which Rebekah had from the oracle she consulted, \"Two nations are in thy womb,\" and of the blessing of Isaac, \"Thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth.\" (Genesis 36)
				</ol>
				<h2 id=\"how-could-moses-have-written-genesis-36\">How could Moses have written Genesis 36? (36:1-43)</h2>
				<p>Zondervan (2006) explains that the reference to kings (in different sections of the Pentateuch), and description of his own death in Genesis 34, indicates that Moses was not the writer of the entire Pentateuch. Nonetheless, it is still traditionally accepted that he was the author of all five books (\"36:1-43 The Descendants of Esau\" section).</p>
				<h2 id=\"why-was-esau-called-edom\">Why was Esau called Edom? (36:1)</h2>
				<p>In Hebrew, Edom literally means \"red\" (Zondervan, 2015). Referring to Esau, Genesis 25:25 says that \"The first to come out was red\". In Genesis 25:30, Esau asked Jacob to give him \"some of that red stew\". According to verse 30, \"That is why he was also called Edom.\" ('ᵉdôm).</p>
				<p>Bolen (n.d.) shares a photography of the wilderness and mountains of Edom:</p>
				<div><img src=\"/teaching/genesis-36-lesson/img/wildernessAndMountainsOfEdom.jpg\" alt=\"Wilderness and mountains of Edom\" width=\"624\" height=\"415\"></div>
				<p>One theory says that the association between the kingdom of Edom and the word \"red\" took place before Esau controlled that region. According to that explanation, the name originated because of the red cliffs located in the area (Got Questions Ministries, n.d., What is the significance of Edom in the Bible?).</p>
				<h2 id=\"why-did-esau-marry-canaanite-women\">Why did Esau marry Canaanite women? (36:2)</h2>
				<p>Zondervan (2019) provides two possibilities:</p>
				<ol class=\"quote\">
					<li>No special reason. Simply because they were nearby and available.
					<li>Political reasons to make peace with people in the area. An example of an international treaty ratified with a wedding is found in 2 Chronicles 18:1: \"Now Jehoshaphat had great wealth and honor, and he allied himself with Ahab by marriage.\" (Genesis 36)
				</ol>
				<p>In Genesis 27:40, one of the prophesies that Isaac pronounced over his son Esau was that he would \"live by the sword\". Having violent and warring people as descendants, Esau may have pursued peace with Elon the Hittite, Zibeon the Hivite, and Nebaioth, by establishing marriage alliances.</p>
				<p>Zondervan (2006) says that the decision of having Canaanite women as wives, suggests that Esau did not care about his relationship with the God of his grandfather Abraham, father Isaac, and brother Jacob. Since his wives did not know God (in a personal relationship), it is almost certain that Esau and his wives raised children who did not know and fear God (\"36:1-43 The Descendants of Esau\" section).</p>
				<h2 id=\"what-is-the-historic-and-prophetic-relationship-between-israel-and-edom\">What is the historic and prophetic relationship between Israel and Edom (36:6-8)</h2>
				<p>Numbers 20:14-21 describes how the king of Edom denied Israel passage through their land. Moses' messengers introduced their request with a reminder of the family links between the nations: \"This is what your brother Israel says\". In addition, as part of the request, the messengers said: \"You know about all the hardships that have come on us.\" That message reveals that the king of Edom knew about the way Egypt treated the Israelites during their years of slavery. He also knew that both nations came from the common ancestor Isaac. Nonetheless, the king replied: \"You may not pass through\". His word was firm, and he was ready to attack Israel if they had gone through Edom's territory. He came out \"against them with a large and powerful army.\"</p>
				<p>It is possible to presume that since the encounter described in Number 20:14-21, the Edomites remained enemies and a threat to Israel until David put groups of soldiers over Edom. Israel conquered them and made them servants to David (2 Samuel 8:14).</p>
				<p>Jewish Virtual Library [JVL] (n.d.) explains that Edom was turned by David into an Israelite province ruled by governors appointed by Israel under David's military command. The motivations for this decision would have been primarily economic because of the trade and maritime routes previously controlled by Edom. The battle and victory of David over Edom would have been difficult but decisive.</p>
				<p>1 Kings 11:15-16 says that \"when David was fighting with Edom, Joab the commander of the army, who had gone up to bury the dead, had struck down all the men in Edom. Joad and all the Israelites stayed there for six months, until they had destroyed all the men in Edom.\" This passage reveals that the battle of David against Edom was not an overnight victory.</p>
				<p>At some point during Solomon's reign (most likely at the end), Edom regained its independence and liberation from Israel (JVL, n.d.)</p>
				<p>Prophets in the Old Testament denounced the hostility of Edom against Israel and God condemned it, expressing His anger and reproval of Edom:</p>
				<ul class=\"quote\">
					<li>\"Edom will be conquered; Seir, his enemy, will be conquered, but Israel will grow strong.\" (complete passage in Numbers 24:18).
					<li>\"They will subdue Edom and Moab, and the Ammonites will be subject to them.\" (complete passage in Isaiah 11:14).
					<li>\"My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens; see, it descends in judgment on Edom, the people I have totally destroyed. The sword of the Lord is bathed in blood, it is covered with fat -the blood of lambs and goats, fat from the kidneys of rams. For the Lord has a sacrifice in Bozrah and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.\" (Isaiah 34:5-6, see entire chapter for additional instances where Edom is mentioned as part of God's judgment against the nations).
					<li>'\"The days are coming,\" declares the Lord, \"when I will punish all who are circumcised only in the flesh -Egypt, Judah, Edom, Ammon, Moab and all who live in the wilderness in distant places. For all these nations are really uncircumcised, and even the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.\"' (Jeremiah 9:25-26).
					<li>Jeremiah 49:7-22, a message of judgement against Edom.
					<li>Ezekiel 25:12-14, a prophecy against Edom.
					<li>Ezekiel 35:1-15, a prophecy against Edom.
					<li>\"But Egypt will be desolate, Edom a desert waste, because of violence done to the people of Judah, in whose land they shed innocent blood.\" (Joel 3:19).
					<li>'This is what the Lord says: \"For three sins of Edom, even for four, I will not relent. Because he pursued his brother with a sword and slaughtered the women of the land, because his anger raged continually and his fury flamed unchecked,' (Amos 1:11).
					<li>'but Esau I have hated, and I have turned his hill country into a wasteland and left his inheritance to the desert jackals.\" Edom may say, \"Though we have been crushed, we will rebuild the ruins.\" But this is what the Lord Almighty says: \"They may build, but I will demolish. They will be called the Wicked Land a people always under the wrath of the Lord.' (Malachi 1:3-4).
				</ul>
				<p>In the millennial kingdom of Christ, Israel will possess the land of Edom according to the prophecy in Obadiah 1:19-21 (Got Questions Ministries, n.d., What is the significance of Edom in the Bible?).</p>
				<h2 id=\"why-did-god-bless-esau-if-he-knew-that-the-edomites-would-not-return-the-favor-and-bless-israel-what-does-this-teach-readers-about-who-god-is-and-how-he-thinks-and-acts\">Why did God bless Esau if He knew that the Edomites would not \"return the favor\" and bless Israel? What does this teach readers about Who God is and how He thinks and acts? (36:6-8)</h2>
				<p>Zondervan (2006) highlights that although Esau may have wandered from God, Genesis 36:6-8 and 36:31-40 reveal that God still remembered Esau and blessed him with wealth, descendants, and kings who would come from his offspring (\"36:1-43 The Descendants of Esau\" section).</p>
				<p>In Deuteronomy 2:5, referring to the descendants of Esau, God gives this command to Israel: \"Do not provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land, not even enough to put your foot on. I have given Esau the hill country of Seir as his own.\" This instruction took place after Israel was taken out of Egypt during the wilderness years. Section \"Historic and prophetic relationship between Israel and Edom (36:6-8)\" of this document provides a list of passages from the Old Testament that reveal how angry God would become with Edom. Nonetheless, God blessed Esau and his descendants as mentioned in the previous paragraph.</p>
				<p>In Genesis 28:13-15, this blessing is pronounced in favor of Jacob: \"I am the Lord, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying. Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. All peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring. I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.\" This promise was given after Jacob had deceived his brother Esau. Considering that, Geoghegan & Homan (2003) provide the following explanation:</p>
				<p class=\"quote\">Now, that's quite a deal for someone who just lied in the name of this God. You may be thinking, \"Where do I sign up?\" However, the more virtuous among us may be thinking, \"This isn't fair.\" And you'd be right. This isn't fair. However, the Bible is trying to make a point about God's character. He is faithful, keeping His promises regardless of the individual behavior of those involved. Because God promised Abraham and Isaac that their descendants would be blessed, and because God said that this blessing would come through Jacob, God intends to keep His word. (chap. 6)</p>
				<p>In Genesis 25:23, God said this to Rebekah after she inquired of the Lord in prayer, asking why the babies jostled each other within her while being pregnant: \"Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you will be separated; one people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger.\" The promise was that Esau would become a nation. God fulfilled it despite the wickedness of Esau. In Hebrews 12:16, Esau is described as godless: \"See that no one is sexually immoral, or is godless like Esau, who for a single meal sold his inheritance rights as the oldest son.\"</p>
				<p>Another example of a covenant of God that is unconditional is found in Genesis 15. The fact that \"God alone passes between the animal pieces, in the form of a smoking furnace from which torch-like flames soot out\" means that this was an unconditional covenant that could only be carried out by God Himself (Thomas Nelson, 2017, p. 35).</p>
				<p>2 Timothy 2:13 says: \"if we are faithless, he remains faithful, for he cannot disown himself.\"</p>
				<h2 id=\"what-is-the-connection-between-esau-that-is-edom-and-seir\">What is the connection between Esau (that is, Edom), and Seir? (36:8-9; 36:20-21; 36:25; 36:30)</h2>
				<p>The region of Seir would have received its name from Seir the Horite (Got Questions Ministries, n.d., What is the significance of Mount Seir?). According to Deuteronomy 2:12, the Horites lived in Seir before that place was occupied by the Edomites: \"Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out. They destroyed the Horites from before them and settled in their place\".</p>
				<p>After invading and conquering Seir, the descendants of the Edomites mixed with the Horites (Bible Study Tools, n.d., \"Horite; Horim\").</p>
				<p>Henry (1811, Genesis 36:20-30) explains that mentioning the natives of Seir as part of the genealogy of the Edomites serves the purpose to show that by intermarrying with people from Seir, the descendants of Esau probably learned their ways and corrupted themselves.</p>
				<h2 id=\"what-is-the-connection-between-esau-that-is-edom-and-the-amalekites\">What is the connection between Esau (that is, Edom), and the Amalekites? (36:12, 16)</h2>
				<p>Amalek was one of the grandsons of Esau. The Amalekites became enemies of the Israelites. Their unrelenting brutality against Israel resulted in God's command for the Israelites to kill them, as shown in Deuteronomy 25:17-19: \"Remember what the Amalekites did to you along the way when you came out of Egypt. When you were weary and worn out, they met you on your journey and attacked all who were lagging behind; they had no fear of God. When the Lord your God gives you rest from all the enemies around you in the land he is giving you to possess as an inheritance, you shall blot out the name of Amalek from under heaven. Do not forget!\" (Got Questions Ministries, n.d., Who were the Amalekites?).</p>
				<p>According to the passage above, the Amalekites were so cruel that they killed Israelites who \"were weary and worn out,\" attacking \"all who were lagging behind\". It is likely that group of people who were \"lagging behind\" included a large proportion of women and children. Exodus 21:23-25 says: \"you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.\" In 1 Samuel 15:2-3, God told Kind Saul to \"attack the Amalekites\", putting to death \"men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.\" It is important to see that the destruction of the Amalekites was a consequence of their own sin, the \"eye for eye, tooth for tooth\" that they deserved. God was faithful to His character and executed justice in this case against the Amalekites.</p>
				<p>Saul disobeyed God because according to 1 Samuel 15, he did not destroy everything that belonged to the Amalekites. \"Saul and the army spared Agag and the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves[b] and lambs—everything that was good.\" (1 Samuel 15:9). As a result, God rejected Saul as king (1 Samuel 15:23).</p>
				<p>1 Chronicles 4:42-43 mentions that five hundred Simeonites invaded Seir and \"killed the remaining Amalekites\".</p>
				<p>It is interesting to learn how God's wisdom ordered to kill the Amalekites. Saul disobeyed, showing \"mercy\" in their favor (in reality, Saul's motives were sinful). In return, future generations of Amalekites who survived were merciless against Israel, resulting in the \"threat of annihilation for all Jews\", as explained by Got Questions Ministries (n.d.):</p>
				<p class=\"quote\">Haman was an Agagite and the son of Hammedatha. Haman was likely a descendent of Agag, king of the Amalekites, long-time enemies of the Jewish people. God had told King Saul to destroy the Amalekites centuries earlier (1 Samuel 15:3), but Saul failed to obey the command. His disobedience led to the loss of his kingdom and, in Esther's time, the threat of annihilation for all Jews. (Who was Haman the Agagite?)</p>

				<div>*Chief among Esau's descendants.</div>
				<p>Fourteen chiefs in List 1. Eleven chiefs in List 2 (the same names in the same order in 1 Chronicles 1:51-54).</p>
				<p>Only Teman and Kenaz appear in both lists. The purpose of the first list is probably to reveal chiefs based on genealogy, while the second list shows who oversaw various regions (Zondervan, 2019, Genesis 36).</p>
				<p>List 1 seems to be genealogical, while List 2 would be geographical/political. None of the lists is exhaustive individually. The passage does not seem to provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the total number of chiefs was 14 + 11 – 2 = 23. Putting List 1 and List 2 together results in 23 chiefs. Nonetheless, the text does not specify that the chapter provides an exhaustive list of chiefs. The author might only be mentioning prominent chiefs.</p>
				<h2 id=\"how-to-interpret-the-greek-word-bebelos-used-in-hebrews-ch12v16-to-describe-esau\">How to interpret the Greek word βέβηλος bebēlos used in Hebrews 12:16 to describe Esau?</h2>
				<p>According to Zondervan (2015), this Greek word means \"godless, irreligious, profane, worldly:– godless (4), irreligious (1)\" (βέβηλος bebēlos).</p>
				<p>Thomas Nelson (2017) further develops the explanation of Esau being a \"profane person\":</p>
				<p class=\"quote\">This profanity (Gr. Bebēlos) involves far more than one's speech; it is a quality of one's life. The author sees this quality exemplified in Esau, even though Esau was not a vile man. In fact, he was less of a crook than his brother Jacob. The author accurately focuses on the one area that revealed Esau as profane -the selling of his birthright. To \"profane\" is to regard something as unhallowed, to treat something sacred as common. Being totally concerned with his temporary and material needs, Esau gave them priority over his rights as the firstborn son and his responsibilities as heir to the blessing of the Abrahamic covenant (Gen. 25:29-34). The result in Esau's life was that afterward, when he wanted the blessing, he was rejected. He repented with tears, but the situation was irrevocable. (p. 1991)</p>
				<p>It is important to understand the kind of repentance that Esau experienced after losing his blessing. Zondervan (2021) provides this explanation:</p>
				<p class=\"quote\">Esau regretted what he did, but he did not truly repent. There is a crucial distinction between regret and repentance. God never rejects true repentance, but he has no interest in worldly sorrow or regret (2 Corinthians 7:10). Esau did not grieve his sin; he grieved the loss of his blessing. He serves as a symbol of one who does not want God but only the blessings of God. Esau shed tears for the loss of his birthright, not tears that cried out for God's restoration. Esau's inclusion serves as a negative example that contrasts with the positive examples of faith in chapter 11. (Hebrews 12:12-17)</p>
				<h2 id=\"how-to-understand-Romans-ch9v13-where-god-hated-esau\">How to understand Romans 9:13, where God \"hated\" Esau?</h2>
				<p>NIV Study Bible Notes (2011) provides two possible explanations to interpret that God \"hated\" Esau:</p>
				<ol class=\"quote\">
					<li>Equivalent to \"Jacob I chose, but Esau I rejected\".
					<li>\"hate\" meaning \"love less\". (Romans 9:13)
				</ol>
				<p>Supporting option 1 above, in terms of pleasing God, the offering of Abel was accepted, while the one of Cain was rejected. In that sense, it could be said that \"Abel was accepted\", while \"Cain was rejected\". Genesis 4:6-7 says that 'the Lord said to Cain, \"Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast? If you do what is right, will you not be accepted?' The obvious answer is \"Yes\", if Cain had done what was right, he would have been accepted. Similarly, it is possible to think that Esau would not have been rejected if he had loved God with all his mind, heart, might and soul.</p>
				<p>Option 2 listed above would go in the direction of using the passive meaning of \"hate\". The same Hebrew שָׂנֵא śānē' is used in Genesis 29:31 where the passage says that \"the Lord saw that Leah was not loved\". In that instance, \"not loved\" could have been translated as \"hated\". To illustrate the interpretation of \"hate\" as \"love less\", it is possible to imagine a billionaire and a millionaire. Both would be wealthy, but in contrast, the millionaire would seem as being \"poor\" next to the billionaire. In the analogy, both Jacob and Esau would have been loved by God, but in contrast, Esau would seem as being \"hated\" by God when compared to the way God loved Jacob. That would be figurative language, specifically a hyperbole.</p>
				<p>The same word \"hate\" is used in Luke 14:26: \"If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters -yes, even their own life- such a person cannot be my disciple.\" This would be a hyperbole meaning that the love for Jesus must be even greater than the love for one's family (NIV Study Bible Notes, 2011, Luke 14:26).</p>
				<p>Malachi 1:3 says: \"but Esau I have hated, and I have turned his hill country into a wasteland and left his inheritance to the desert jackals.\" The word \"hated\" in that passage is translated according to (Zondervan, 2015) from the Hebrew שָׂנֵא śānē', which has multiple meanings, some of which are:</p>
				<ul class=\"quote\">
					<li>\"hate\" can be active, as an enemy or adversary; or passive, as someone unloved or shunned
					<li>am not loved 
					<li>are shunned (śānē')
				</ul>
				<p>To answer the question, \"does God play favorites\", Zondervan (2019) explains two main schools of thought (Arminianism and Calvinism) regarding God's election, before concluding that \"The mystery of how God works in election is not easily resolved\":</p>
				<ol class=\"quote\">
					<li>Some hold the view that God elects some to be saved because he knows beforehand that they will choose to accept Christ (8:29). Their election, according to this view, is based on God's foreknowledge and involves human free will, that is, people's ability to accept or reject salvation (this belief is known as Arminianism).
					<li>Others conclude that God, in his wise and sovereign will, elects some but not others for reasons we cannot understand. His selection may seem unfair, but that is simply because we have a limited perspective. Humans, bound in sin, do not naturally seek God (3:11), but when God's grace comes to the elect, it enables them to choose God (this belief is known as Calvinism). (Romans 9:8-33)
