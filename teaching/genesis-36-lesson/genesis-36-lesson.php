				<p class=\"quote\">WARNING. In Genesis 5, you encounter what is perhaps one of the most vicious, merciless creatures in the entire Bible. We refer, of course, to the dreaded \"who begat whom\" lists. Actually, you come across these genealogical monsters not only in Genesis 5, but in many places throughout the Bible, leading people to ask, \"Why would the biblical authors waste so much precious space on such trivialities?\" And perhaps more importantly, \"Should I read them?\"</p>
				<p class=\"quote\">TECHNICAL STUFF. The reason the Bible preserves so many genealogies is because in ancient Israel (as in many cultures both then and now), family lineage or clan affiliation is essential for knowing one's place in the world. This concept is most obvious in the case of royalty, where one's connection to the royal family can produce significant benefits (or, in the case of certain royal families, significant detriments). In ancient Israel, the priesthood was also hereditary, as were inheritance rights and territorial claims. Therefore, careful preservation of one's family line was essential for securing rights and wealth for oneself and one's descendants.</p>
