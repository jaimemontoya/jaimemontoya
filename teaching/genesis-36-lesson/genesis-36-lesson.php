				<h2 id=\"purpose-of-biblical-genealogies\">Purpose of biblical genealogies</h2>
				<p>Geoghegan & Homan (2003) explain the purpose and meaning of biblical genealogies:</p>
				<p class=\"quote\">The First (of Many) Biblical Genealogies (Genesis 5)</p>
				<p class=\"quote\">WARNING. In Genesis 5, you encounter what is perhaps one of the most vicious, merciless creatures in the entire Bible. We refer, of course, to the dreaded \"who begat whom\" lists. Actually, you come across these genealogical monsters not only in Genesis 5, but in many places throughout the Bible, leading people to ask, \"Why would the biblical authors waste so much precious space on such trivialities?\" And perhaps more importantly, \"Should I read them?\"</p>
				<p class=\"quote\">TECHNICAL STUFF. The reason the Bible preserves so many genealogies is because in ancient Israel (as in many cultures both then and now), family lineage or clan affiliation is essential for knowing one's place in the world. This concept is most obvious in the case of royalty, where one's connection to the royal family can produce significant benefits (or, in the case of certain royal families, significant detriments). In ancient Israel, the priesthood was also hereditary, as were inheritance rights and territorial claims. Therefore, careful preservation of one's family line was essential for securing rights and wealth for oneself and one's descendants.</p>
				<p class=\"quote\">Beyond their value for ancient Israel, the Bible's genealogies sometimes convey important information about the biblical authors' beliefs and values. For example, in Genesis 5, amidst all the \"who begat whoms,\" we read:</p>
				<p class=\"quote italic\">When Enoch had lived 65 years, he became the father of Methuselah. Enoch walked with God after the birth of Methuselah for 300 years, and had other sons and daughters. Thus, all the days of Enoch were 365 years. Enoch walked with God, and then he was no more, because God took him.</p>
				<p class=\"quote\">-GENESIS 5:21-24</p>
				<p class=\"quote\">Most interpreters understand the notice that \"Enoch walked with God\" to be a euphemism for \"having a close relationship with\" and \"obeying\" God. That is, the purpose of this particular genealogical notice is to make a theological point: God rewards those who seek to know Him and do what He commands. So what is Enoch's reward? Although some scholars have suggested that \"God took him\" simply means that Enoch died (hardly a reward for walking with God), most scholars agree that this phrase means that Enoch went to heaven. (In Trek-talk, God \"beamed him up.\") (chap. 4)</p>
				<p>Since the Old Testament included prophecies about the Saviour, one of the special uses of genealogies in the Scripture is \"for the clearing of the pedigrees of the Messiah\" (Henry, 1811, 1 Chronicles 1).</p>
				<h2 id=\"why-an-entire-chapter-given-to-esau-s-descendants\">Why an entire chapter given to Esau's descendants? (36:1-43)</h2>
				<p>Henry (1811) provides three reasons to keep a register of Esau's family in Genesis 36:</p>
				<ol class=\"quote\">
					<li>Because he was the son of Isaac, for whose sake this honour is put upon him.
					<li>Because the Edomites were neighbours to Israel, and their genealogy would be of use to give light to the following stories of what passed between them.
					<li>It is to show the performance of the promise to Abraham, that he should be \"the father of many nations,\" and of that answer which Rebekah had from the oracle she consulted, \"Two nations are in thy womb,\" and of the blessing of Isaac, \"Thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth.\" (Genesis 36)
				</ol>
				<h2 id=\"how-could-moses-have-written-genesis-36\">How could Moses have written Genesis 36? (36:1-43)</h2>
				<p>Zondervan (2006) explains that the reference to kings (in different sections of the Pentateuch), and description of his own death in Genesis 34, indicates that Moses was not the writer of the entire Pentateuch. Nonetheless, it is still traditionally accepted that he was the author of all five books (\"36:1-43 The Descendants of Esau\" section).</p>
				<h2 id=\"why-was-esau-called-edom\">Why was Esau called Edom? (36:1)</h2>
				<p>In Hebrew, Edom literally means \"red\" (Zondervan, 2015). Referring to Esau, Genesis 25:25 says that \"The first to come out was red\". In Genesis 25:30, Esau asked Jacob to give him \"some of that red stew\". According to verse 30, \"That is why he was also called Edom.\" ('ᵉdôm).</p>
				<p>Bolen (n.d.) shares a photography of the wilderness and mountains of Edom:</p>
				<div><img src=\"/teaching/genesis-36-lesson/img/wildernessAndMountainsOfEdom.jpg\" alt=\"Wilderness and mountains of Edom\" width=\"624\" height=\"415\"></div>
				<p>One theory says that the association between the kingdom of Edom and the word \"red\" took place before Esau controlled that region. According to that explanation, the name originated because of the red cliffs located in the area (Got Questions Ministries, n.d., What is the significance of Edom in the Bible?).</p>
				<h2 id=\"why-did-esau-marry-canaanite-women\">Why did Esau marry Canaanite women? (36:2)</h2>
				<p>Zondervan (2019) provides two possibilities:</p>
				<ol class=\"quote\">
					<li>No special reason. Simply because they were nearby and available.
					<li>Political reasons to make peace with people in the area. An example of an international treaty ratified with a wedding is found in 2 Chronicles 18:1: \"Now Jehoshaphat had great wealth and honor, and he allied himself with Ahab by marriage.\" (Genesis 36)
				</ol>
				<p>In Genesis 27:40, one of the prophesies that Isaac pronounced over his son Esau was that he would \"live by the sword\". Having violent and warring people as descendants, Esau may have pursued peace with Elon the Hittite, Zibeon the Hivite, and Nebaioth, by establishing marriage alliances.</p>
				<p>Zondervan (2006) says that the decision of having Canaanite women as wives, suggests that Esau did not care about his relationship with the God of his grandfather Abraham, father Isaac, and brother Jacob. Since his wives did not know God (in a personal relationship), it is almost certain that Esau and his wives raised children who did not know and fear God (\"36:1-43 The Descendants of Esau\" section).</p>
				<h2 id=\"what-is-the-historic-and-prophetic-relationship-between-israel-and-edom\">What is the historic and prophetic relationship between Israel and Edom (36:6-8)</h2>
				<p>Numbers 20:14-21 describes how the king of Edom denied Israel passage through their land. Moses' messengers introduced their request with a reminder of the family links between the nations: \"This is what your brother Israel says\". In addition, as part of the request, the messengers said: \"You know about all the hardships that have come on us.\" That message reveals that the king of Edom knew about the way Egypt treated the Israelites during their years of slavery. He also knew that both nations came from the common ancestor Isaac. Nonetheless, the king replied: \"You may not pass through\". His word was firm, and he was ready to attack Israel if they had gone through Edom's territory. He came out \"against them with a large and powerful army.\"</p>
				<p>It is possible to presume that since the encounter described in Number 20:14-21, the Edomites remained enemies and a threat to Israel until David put groups of soldiers over Edom. Israel conquered them and made them servants to David (2 Samuel 8:14).</p>
				<p>Jewish Virtual Library [JVL] (n.d.) explains that Edom was turned by David into an Israelite province ruled by governors appointed by Israel under David's military command. The motivations for this decision would have been primarily economic because of the trade and maritime routes previously controlled by Edom. The battle and victory of David over Edom would have been difficult but decisive.</p>
				<p>1 Kings 11:15-16 says that \"when David was fighting with Edom, Joab the commander of the army, who had gone up to bury the dead, had struck down all the men in Edom. Joad and all the Israelites stayed there for six months, until they had destroyed all the men in Edom.\" This passage reveals that the battle of David against Edom was not an overnight victory.</p>
				<p>At some point during Solomon's reign (most likely at the end), Edom regained its independence and liberation from Israel (JVL, n.d.)</p>
				<p>Prophets in the Old Testament denounced the hostility of Edom against Israel and God condemned it, expressing His anger and reproval of Edom:</p>
				<ul class=\"quote\">
					<li>\"Edom will be conquered; Seir, his enemy, will be conquered, but Israel will grow strong.\" (complete passage in Numbers 24:18).
					<li>\"They will subdue Edom and Moab, and the Ammonites will be subject to them.\" (complete passage in Isaiah 11:14).
					<li>\"My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens; see, it descends in judgment on Edom, the people I have totally destroyed. The sword of the Lord is bathed in blood, it is covered with fat -the blood of lambs and goats, fat from the kidneys of rams. For the Lord has a sacrifice in Bozrah and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.\" (Isaiah 34:5-6, see entire chapter for additional instances where Edom is mentioned as part of God's judgment against the nations).
					<li>'\"The days are coming,\" declares the Lord, \"when I will punish all who are circumcised only in the flesh -Egypt, Judah, Edom, Ammon, Moab and all who live in the wilderness in distant places. For all these nations are really uncircumcised, and even the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.\"' (Jeremiah 9:25-26).
					<li>Jeremiah 49:7-22, a message of judgement against Edom.
					<li>Ezekiel 25:12-14, a prophecy against Edom.
					<li>Ezekiel 35:1-15, a prophecy against Edom.
					<li>\"But Egypt will be desolate, Edom a desert waste, because of violence done to the people of Judah, in whose land they shed innocent blood.\" (Joel 3:19).
					<li>'This is what the Lord says: \"For three sins of Edom, even for four, I will not relent. Because he pursued his brother with a sword and slaughtered the women of the land, because his anger raged continually and his fury flamed unchecked,' (Amos 1:11).
					<li>'but Esau I have hated, and I have turned his hill country into a wasteland and left his inheritance to the desert jackals.\" Edom may say, \"Though we have been crushed, we will rebuild the ruins.\" But this is what the Lord Almighty says: \"They may build, but I will demolish. They will be called the Wicked Land a people always under the wrath of the Lord.' (Malachi 1:3-4).
				</ul>
				<p>In the millennial kingdom of Christ, Israel will possess the land of Edom according to the prophecy in Obadiah 1:19-21 (Got Questions Ministries, n.d., What is the significance of Edom in the Bible?).</p>
