				<h2 id=\"levirate-marriage-in-ancient-israelite-society\">Levirate marriage in ancient Israelite society</h2>
				<p>This custom or law was used in ancient Israelite society “to perpetuate the line of a man who died without offspring.” (Encyclopædia Britannica, n.d., levirate).</p>
				<p>Weisberg (2009) explains that the Israelites did not invent levirate, but they adapted it to their needs. She provides reasons that reveal why it is not surprising that Israelite society practiced levirate:</p>
				<ul class=\"quote\">
					<li>Continuity of the family and preservation of familial land were important.
					<li>Inheritance was patrilineal.
					<li>Wives were not recognized as their husband’s heirs. (Chapter 1)
				</ul>
				<p>Levirate marriage “was designed to prevent extinction of the family name and property” (Nelson, 2017, p. 351). According to Deuteronomy 25:5-10, its primary goal was “to provide the deceased with an heir.” (Weisberg, 2009, Chapter 2). The text acknowledges that it is possible that “the man does not want to marry his brother’s [widowed] wife” (Deuteronomy 25:7, Amplified Bible). Weisberg (2009) says that based on this Deuteronomy passage, the man is not obliged to offer an explanation, but he could simply say, “I do not want to marry her”, even when that would be “a refusal to honor his obligations to his brother”. Weisberg provides an interpretation that rationalizes why a man might refuse to marry his brother’s widow:</p>
				<p class=\"quote\">One could argue that levirate marriage is a completely altruistic act on the part of a brother. A man has little or nothing to gain and a great deal to lose by providing his brother with a posthumous heir. The death of a childless man would result in larger portions of the paternal estate going to the surviving brothers. Levirate marriage, if “successful,” results in the original distribution of property being maintained. Furthermore, the “loss” incurred by the levir comes through a child he himself has fathered; the levir is disinherited through his own actions! The only incentive Deuteronomy offers the levir is couched in negative terms; by agreeing to perform levirate marriage, he spares himself -and his descendants- public humiliation. (Chapter 2).</p>
				<p>Three passages in the Old Testament mention levirate marriage: Genesis 38, Deuteronomy 25, and Ruth. In the New Testament, the Sadducees quoted levirate marriage when they came with a question to Jesus, as described in Matthew 22:23-32, but they were quoting the passage in Deuteronomy 25:5-10.</p>
				<h2 id=\"even-if-god-did-not-institute-levirate-marriage-why-does-he-condone-it\">Even if God did not institute levirate marriage, why does he condone it?</h2>
				<p>Dean & Ballinger (n.d.) explain that levirate marriage was designed to protect childless widows by providing a source of income for them. In addition, levirate marriage law was designed to preserve and protect inheritance (The Levirate Marriage Custom).</p>
				<p>Can imperfections be found in the levirate marriage custom/law? Yes, they can. Is God guilty of those imperfections? No, He is not. An example of an imperfect solution that God allowed even in the Mosaic legal system is divorce. Jesus explained in Matthew 19:8 that the original and perfect design of God did not include divorce. But the sin and imperfections of human beings made it necessary for God to allow divorce under some circumstances: “Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning.” Similarly, when God created Adam and Eve, death did not even exist. The Fall produced death, which resulted in the possibility of a woman to become a widow. Inheritance rights and the continuity of a family line were at risk of being lost. An imperfect solution to the problem was regulated in the Law of Moses in the form of levirate marriage (Deuteronomy 25:5-10).</p>
				<p>The imperfect solutions (levirate marriage and divorce) to big problems (death and adultery) should not be used as arguments to blame God for the countless big human problems. Contrary to that, the righteous reaction should be to realize that the solutions provided in the Law of Moses are imperfect and temporary. The final, permanent, and perfect solution is in Jesus Christ. The contrast between the Old Covenant represented by the Law of Moses, and the New Covenant revealed in Jesus, is thoroughly explained in the book of Hebrews. This truth is explicitly stated in Hebrews 8:7: “For if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant, no place would have been sought for another.”</p>

				<p>Frymer-Kensky (n.d.) provides a financial explanation of what could have motivated Onan to forsake his levirate marriage responsibility:</p>
				<p class=\"quote\">According to inheritance customs, the estate of Judah, who had three sons, would be divided into four equal parts, with the eldest son acquiring one half and the others one fourth each. A child engendered for Er would inherit at least one fourth and possibly one half (as the son of the firstborn). If Er remained childless, then Judah’s estate would be divided into three, with the eldest, most probably Onan, inheriting two thirds. Onan opts to preserve his financial advantage and interrupts coitus with Tamar, spilling his semen on the ground. For this, God punishes Onan with death, as God had previously punished Er for doing something wicked. (Tamar: Bible).</p>
				<p>The following pie charts provide a way to visualize the distribution of the inheritance in different scenarios presented in Genesis 38:</p>
