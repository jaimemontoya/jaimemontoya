Before answering that question, I want to explain that I mentioned specifically DigitalOcean because from the four well-known cloud hosting options that I know (DigitalOcean, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services), DigitalOcean is the least expensive:</p><div><img src=\"/blog/2023/10/17/18/00/img/digitalocean-vs-competitors.jpg\" alt=\"DigitalOcean versus competitors\" width=\"863\" height=\"409\"></div><p>$6 a month may sound like a good deal. However, that solution would require hosting my own databases. In my experience, self-hosted databases and/or mail servers is not advisable because of their inherent challenges. For example, I posted at <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76788812/mysql-suddenly-exited-execstart-usr-sbin-mysqld-daemonize-pid-file-run-mys\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76788812/mysql-suddenly-exited-execstart-usr-sbin-mysqld-daemonize-pid-file-run-mys</a> an issue I experienced with MySQL randomly failing for no apparent reason after several days of running without problems. The fix was easy, as I mentioned in that question: start/restart the MySQL service. But having that uncertainty of not knowing when MySQL will suddenly fail is unacceptable for a production system. The Stack Overflow user @suchislife wrote a comment to my question, that I 100% agree with:</p><p>\"They way I fixed this was to stop hosting my own databases. Such a risk. Now I rent a managed MySQL database cluster with full access from digital ocean and it stays online for years. Email & Database hosting is no joke. Let a data-center manage hardware, patch updates and uptime so that you can focus on actual coding.\"</p><p>I am assuming that in his last sentence, @suchislife was referring exclusively to hosting email and database. Otherwise, I would disagree only with that sentence because hosting everything else (even if excluding specifically email and database) on a self-hosted server is precisely the concept behind using a cloud hosting for developers solution in the form of infrastructure as a service (IaaS). The solution proposed by @suchislife, as I understand it, would be to use platform as a service (PaaS) for email and database, and IaaS for everything else.</p><p>The cost of a basic DigitalOcean MySQL Managed Database is currently $15.00/month:</p><div><img src=\"/blog/2023/10/17/18/00/img/digitalocean-mysql-managed-database-pricing.jpg\" alt=\"DigitalOcean MySQL Managed Database pricing\" width=\"528\" height=\"295\"></div><p>From its own website, DigitalOcean discourages people from running self-hosted mail servers: <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/why-you-may-not-want-to-run-your-own-mail-server\">https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/why-you-may-not-want-to-run-your-own-mail-server</a>. In previous paragraphs I discussed why I agree with that advice. That means adding the extra cost for hosting email elsewhere.</p> The cost for a basic business email with Google is $6.00/month (or $7.20 per user per month when billed monthly):</p><div><img src=\"/blog/2023/10/17/18/00/img/email-pricing.jpg\" alt=\"Email-pricing\" width=\"265\" height=\"119\"></div><p>Backups for a basic Droplet (DigitalOcean virtual machine or server) has a cost of $1.20/month:</p><div><img src=\"/blog/2023/10/17/18/00/img/digitalocean-backups.jpg\" alt=\"DigitalOcean backups\" width=\"339\" height=\"445\"></div><p>Adding up the aforementioned prices for the DigitalOcean + Google business email solution, the result is $28.2/month. The InMotion Hosting solution, which includes email and MySQL database as part of their service, has a price of $15.49/month after including the cost of $2.50/month for automatic back-ups. In this case, the PaaS is significantly less expensive than the IaaS solution.</p><p>I prefer IaaS than PaaS for web hosting because it provides full control, flexibility, and opportunity to scale. Nonetheless, as shown in this post, IaaS may not always be the least expensive option, and it requires more technical expertise for installation, implementation, upgrades, security and maintenance.</p><hr>\n";
