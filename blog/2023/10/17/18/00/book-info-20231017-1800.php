Before answering that question, I want to explain that I mentioned specifically DigitalOcean because from the four well-known cloud hosting options that I know (DigitalOcean, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services), DigitalOcean is the least expensive:</p><img src=\"/blog/2023/10/17/18/00/img/digital-ocean-vs-competitors.jpg\" alt=\"DigitalOcean versus competitors\" width=\"863\" height=\"409\"><p>$6 a month may sound like a good deal. However, that solution would require hosting my own databases. In my experience, self-hosted databases and/or mail servers is not advisable because of their inherent challenges. For example, I posted at <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76788812/mysql-suddenly-exited-execstart-usr-sbin-mysqld-daemonize-pid-file-run-mys\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76788812/mysql-suddenly-exited-execstart-usr-sbin-mysqld-daemonize-pid-file-run-mys</a> an issue I experienced with MySQL randomly failing for no apparent reason after several days of running without problems. The fix was easy, as I mentioned in that question: start/restart the MySQL service. But having that uncertainty of not knowing when MySQL will suddenly fail is unacceptable for a production system. The StackOverflow user @suchislife wrote a comment to my question, that I 100% agree with:</p><hr>\n";
