I went to my cPanel account at <a href=\"https://secure261.inmotionhosting.com:2083/\">https://secure261.inmotionhosting.com:2083/</a> to obtain my FTP credentials:</p><div><img src=\"/blog/2023/12/10/05/59/img/cPanelLoginScreen.jpg\" alt=\"cPanel login screen\" width=\"546\" height=\"622\"></div><p>This was the first screen after a successful cPanel login:</p><div><img src=\"/blog/2023/12/10/05/59/img/cPanelFirstScreen.jpg\" alt=\"cPanel first screen\" width=\"1851\" height=\"965\"></div><p>I scrolled down to find the FTP Accounts link:</p><div><img src=\"/blog/2023/12/10/05/59/img/ftpAccountsLinkFromcPanel.jpg\" alt=\"FTP Accounts link from cPanel\" width=\"1215\" height=\"976\"></div><p>I found the FTP Username Account that I needed to connect to the server using FTP:</p><div><img src=\"/blog/2023/12/10/05/59/img/ftpUsernameAccountFound.jpg\" alt=\"FTP Username Account found\" width=\"946\" height=\"418\"></div><p>The information above does not specify Host nor the password to connect via FTP.

For the Host value, I could use either <span class=\"cod\">173.231.209.31</span> (the shared IP address) or <span class=\"cod\">secure261.inmotionhosting.com</span>. That was all I needed to connect to the server using FTP via FileZilla:</p><div><img src=\"/blog/2023/12/10/05/59/img/connectUsingFTPViaFileZilla.jpg\" alt=\"Connect using FTP via FileZilla\" width=\"703\" height=\"97\"></div><p>I clicked OK to the Unknown certificate pop-up message:</p><div><img src=\"/blog/2023/12/10/05/59/img/unknownCertificateFileZillaConnection.jpg\" alt=\"Unknown certificate FileZilla connection\" width=\"705\" height=\"919\"></div><p>My WordPress files on the server were displayed under the <span class=\"cod\">/unionchurchss.org</span> folder:</p><div><img src=\"/blog/2023/12/10/05/59/img/wordPressFilesOnServer.jpg\" alt=\"WordPress files on server\" width=\"1296\" height=\"783\"></div><p>20406 files were transferred successfully:</p><div><img src=\"/blog/2023/12/10/05/59/img/successfulTransfers.jpg\" alt=\"Successful transfers\" width=\"1915\" height=\"1028\"></div><p>The process resulted in 310 failed transfers:</p><div><img src=\"/blog/2023/12/10/05/59/img/failedTransfers.jpg\" alt=\"Successful transfers\" width=\"1919\" height=\"1029\"></div><p>All of the failed transfers are from this directory: <span class=\"cod\">unionchurchss.org&bsol;wp-content&bsol;plugins&bsol;boldgrid-backup-premium&bsol;vendor&bsol;google&bsol;apiclient-services&bsol;src&bsol;Google&bsol;Service&bsol;</span>.
